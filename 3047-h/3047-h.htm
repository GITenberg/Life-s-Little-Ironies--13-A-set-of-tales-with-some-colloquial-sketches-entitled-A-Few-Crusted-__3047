<h2>THE SON&rsquo;S VETO</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>To the eyes of a man viewing it from behind, the nut-brown
hair was a wonder and a mystery.&nbsp; Under the black beaver
hat, surmounted by its tuft of black feathers, the long locks,
braided and twisted and coiled like the rushes of a basket,
composed a rare, if somewhat barbaric, example of ingenious
art.&nbsp; One could understand such weavings and coilings being
wrought to last intact for a year, or even a calendar month; but
that they should be all demolished regularly at bedtime, after a
single day of permanence, seemed a reckless waste of successful
fabrication.</p>
<p>And she had done it all herself, poor thing.&nbsp; She had no
maid, and it was almost the only accomplishment she could boast
of.&nbsp; Hence the unstinted pains.</p>
<p>She was a young invalid lady&mdash;not so very much of an
invalid&mdash;sitting in a wheeled chair, which had been pulled
up in the front part of a green enclosure, close to a bandstand,
where a concert was going on, during a warm June afternoon.&nbsp;
It had place in one of the minor parks or private gardens that
are to be found in the suburbs of London, and was the effort of a
local association to raise money for some charity.&nbsp; There
are worlds within worlds in the great city, and though nobody
outside the immediate district had ever heard of the charity, or
the band, or the garden, the enclosure was filled with an
interested audience sufficiently informed on all these.</p>
<p>As the strains proceeded many of the listeners observed the
chaired lady, whose back hair, by reason of her prominent
position, so challenged inspection.&nbsp; Her face was not easily
discernible, but the aforesaid cunning tress-weavings, the white
ear and poll, and the curve of a cheek which was neither flaccid
nor sallow, were signals that led to the expectation of good
beauty in front.&nbsp; Such expectations are not infrequently
disappointed as soon as the disclosure comes; and in the present
case, when the lady, by a turn of the head, at length revealed
herself, she was not so handsome as the people behind her had
supposed, and even hoped&mdash;they did not know why.</p>
<p>For one thing (alas! the commonness of this complaint), she
was less young than they had fancied her to be.&nbsp; Yet
attractive her face unquestionably was, and not at all
sickly.&nbsp; The revelation of its details came each time she
turned to talk to a boy of twelve or thirteen who stood beside
her, and the shape of whose hat and jacket implied that he
belonged to a well-known public school.&nbsp; The immediate
bystanders could hear that he called her
&lsquo;Mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the end of the recital was reached, and the audience
withdrew, many chose to find their way out by passing at her
elbow.&nbsp; Almost all turned their heads to take a full and
near look at the interesting woman, who remained stationary in
the chair till the way should be clear enough for her to be
wheeled out without obstruction.&nbsp; As if she expected their
glances, and did not mind gratifying their curiosity, she met the
eyes of several of her observers by lifting her own, showing
these to be soft, brown, and affectionate orbs, a little
plaintive in their regard.</p>
<p>She was conducted out of the gardens, and passed along the
pavement till she disappeared from view, the schoolboy walking
beside her.&nbsp; To inquiries made by some persons who watched
her away, the answer came that she was the second wife of the
incumbent of a neighbouring parish, and that she was lame.&nbsp;
She was generally believed to be a woman with a story&mdash;an
innocent one, but a story of some sort or other.</p>
<p>In conversing with her on their way home the boy who walked at
her elbow said that he hoped his father had not missed them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He have been so comfortable these last few hours that I
am sure he cannot have missed us,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Has</i>, dear mother&mdash;not <i>have</i>!&rsquo;
exclaimed the public-school boy, with an impatient fastidiousness
that was almost harsh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely you know that by this
time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His mother hastily adopted the correction, and did not resent
his making it, or retaliate, as she might well have done, by
bidding him to wipe that crumby mouth of his, whose condition had
been caused by surreptitious attempts to eat a piece of cake
without taking it out of the pocket wherein it lay
concealed.&nbsp; After this the pretty woman and the boy went
onward in silence.</p>
<p>That question of grammar bore upon her history, and she fell
into reverie, of a somewhat sad kind to all appearance.&nbsp; It
might have been assumed that she was wondering if she had done
wisely in shaping her life as she had shaped it, to bring out
such a result as this.</p>
<p>In a remote nook in North Wessex, forty miles from London,
near the thriving county-town of Aldbrickham, there stood a
pretty village with its church and parsonage, which she knew well
enough, but her son had never seen.&nbsp; It was her native
village, Gaymead, and the first event bearing upon her present
situation had occurred at that place when she was only a girl of
nineteen.</p>
<p>How well she remembered it, that first act in her little
tragi-comedy, the death of her reverend husband&rsquo;s first
wife.&nbsp; It happened on a spring evening, and she who now and
for many years had filled that first wife&rsquo;s place was then
parlour-maid in the parson&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>When everything had been done that could be done, and the
death was announced, she had gone out in the dusk to visit her
parents, who were living in the same village, to tell them the
sad news.&nbsp; As she opened the white swing-gate and looked
towards the trees which rose westward, shutting out the pale
light of the evening sky, she discerned, without much surprise,
the figure of a man standing in the hedge, though she roguishly
exclaimed as a matter of form, &lsquo;Oh, Sam, how you frightened
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a young gardener of her acquaintance.&nbsp; She told
him the particulars of the late event, and they stood silent,
these two young people, in that elevated, calmly philosophic mind
which is engendered when a tragedy has happened close at hand,
and has not happened to the philosophers themselves.&nbsp; But it
had its bearing upon their relations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And will you stay on now at the Vicarage, just the
same?&rsquo; asked he.</p>
<p>She had hardly thought of that.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, yes&mdash;I
suppose!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Everything will be just as
usual, I imagine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He walked beside her towards her mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Presently his arm stole round her waist.&nbsp; She gently removed
it; but he placed it there again, and she yielded the
point.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see, dear Sophy, you don&rsquo;t know
that you&rsquo;ll stay on; you may want a home; and I shall be
ready to offer one some day, though I may not be ready just
yet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Sam, how can you be so fast!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
never even said I liked &rsquo;ee; and it is all your own doing,
coming after me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, it is nonsense to say I am not to have a try at
you like the rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; He stooped to kiss her a
farewell, for they had reached her mother&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Sam; you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she cried,
putting her hand over his mouth.&nbsp; &lsquo;You ought to be
more serious on such a night as this.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she bade
him adieu without allowing him to kiss her or to come
indoors.</p>
<p>The vicar just left a widower was at this time a man about
forty years of age, of good family, and childless.&nbsp; He had
led a secluded existence in this college living, partly because
there were no resident landowners; and his loss now intensified
his habit of withdrawal from outward observation.&nbsp; He was
still less seen than heretofore, kept himself still less in time
with the rhythm and racket of the movements called progress in
the world without.&nbsp; For many months after his wife&rsquo;s
decease the economy of his household remained as before; the
cook, the housemaid, the parlour-maid, and the man out-of-doors
performed their duties or left them undone, just as Nature
prompted them&mdash;the vicar knew not which.&nbsp; It was then
represented to him that his servants seemed to have nothing to do
in his small family of one.&nbsp; He was struck with the truth of
this representation, and decided to cut down his
establishment.&nbsp; But he was forestalled by Sophy, the
parlour-maid, who said one evening that she wished to leave
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why?&rsquo; said the parson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sam Hobson has asked me to marry him, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;do you want to marry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not much.&nbsp; But it would be a home for me.&nbsp;
And we have heard that one of us will have to leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A day or two after she said: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
leave just yet, sir, if you don&rsquo;t wish it.&nbsp; Sam and I
have quarrelled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at her.&nbsp; He had hardly ever observed her
before, though he had been frequently conscious of her soft
presence in the room.&nbsp; What a kitten-like, flexuous, tender
creature she was!&nbsp; She was the only one of the servants with
whom he came into immediate and continuous relation.&nbsp; What
should he do if Sophy were gone?</p>
<p>Sophy did not go, but one of the others did, and things went
on quietly again.</p>
<p>When Mr. Twycott, the vicar, was ill, Sophy brought up his
meals to him, and she had no sooner left the room one day than he
heard a noise on the stairs.&nbsp; She had slipped down with the
tray, and so twisted her foot that she could not stand.&nbsp; The
village surgeon was called in; the vicar got better, but Sophy
was incapacitated for a long time; and she was informed that she
must never again walk much or engage in any occupation which
required her to stand long on her feet.&nbsp; As soon as she was
comparatively well she spoke to him alone.&nbsp; Since she was
forbidden to walk and bustle about, and, indeed, could not do so,
it became her duty to leave.&nbsp; She could very well work at
something sitting down, and she had an aunt a seamstress.</p>
<p>The parson had been very greatly moved by what she had
suffered on his account, and he exclaimed, &lsquo;No, Sophy; lame
or not lame, I cannot let you go.&nbsp; You must never leave me
again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He came close to her, and, though she could never exactly tell
how it happened, she became conscious of his lips upon her
cheek.&nbsp; He then asked her to marry him.&nbsp; Sophy did not
exactly love him, but she had a respect for him which almost
amounted to veneration.&nbsp; Even if she had wished to get away
from him she hardly dared refuse a personage so reverend and
august in her eyes, and she assented forthwith to be his
wife.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that one fine morning, when the doors of the
church were naturally open for ventilation, and the singing birds
fluttered in and alighted on the tie-beams of the roof, there was
a marriage-service at the communion-rails, which hardly a soul
knew of.&nbsp; The parson and a neighbouring curate had entered
at one door, and Sophy at another, followed by two necessary
persons, whereupon in a short time there emerged a newly-made
husband and wife.</p>
<p>Mr. Twycott knew perfectly well that he had committed social
suicide by this step, despite Sophy&rsquo;s spotless character,
and he had taken his measures accordingly.&nbsp; An exchange of
livings had been arranged with an acquaintance who was incumbent
of a church in the south of London, and as soon as possible the
couple removed thither, abandoning their pretty country home,
with trees and shrubs and glebe, for a narrow, dusty house in a
long, straight street, and their fine peal of bells for the
wretchedest one-tongued clangour that ever tortured mortal
ears.&nbsp; It was all on her account.&nbsp; They were, however,
away from every one who had known her former position; and also
under less observation from without than they would have had to
put up with in any country parish.</p>
<p>Sophy the woman was as charming a partner as a man could
possess, though Sophy the lady had her deficiencies.&nbsp; She
showed a natural aptitude for little domestic refinements, so far
as related to things and manners; but in what is called culture
she was less intuitive.&nbsp; She had now been married more than
fourteen years, and her husband had taken much trouble with her
education; but she still held confused ideas on the use of
&lsquo;was&rsquo; and &lsquo;were,&rsquo; which did not beget a
respect for her among the few acquaintances she made.&nbsp; Her
great grief in this relation was that her only child, on whose
education no expense had been and would be spared, was now old
enough to perceive these deficiencies in his mother, and not only
to see them but to feel irritated at their existence.</p>
<p>Thus she lived on in the city, and wasted hours in braiding
her beautiful hair, till her once apple cheeks waned to pink of
the very faintest.&nbsp; Her foot had never regained its natural
strength after the accident, and she was mostly obliged to avoid
walking altogether.&nbsp; Her husband had grown to like London
for its freedom and its domestic privacy; but he was twenty years
his Sophy&rsquo;s senior, and had latterly been seized with a
serious illness.&nbsp; On this day, however, he had seemed to be
well enough to justify her accompanying her son Randolph to the
concert.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>The next time we get a glimpse of her is when she appears in
the mournful attire of a widow.</p>
<p>Mr. Twycott had never rallied, and now lay in a well-packed
cemetery to the south of the great city, where, if all the dead
it contained had stood erect and alive, not one would have known
him or recognized his name.&nbsp; The boy had dutifully followed
him to the grave, and was now again at school.</p>
<p>Throughout these changes Sophy had been treated like the child
she was in nature though not in years.&nbsp; She was left with no
control over anything that had been her husband&rsquo;s beyond
her modest personal income.&nbsp; In his anxiety lest her
inexperience should be overreached he had safeguarded with
trustees all he possibly could.&nbsp; The completion of the
boy&rsquo;s course at the public school, to be followed in due
time by Oxford and ordination, had been all previsioned and
arranged, and she really had nothing to occupy her in the world
but to eat and drink, and make a business of indolence, and go on
weaving and coiling the nut-brown hair, merely keeping a home
open for the son whenever he came to her during vacations.</p>
<p>Foreseeing his probable decease long years before her, her
husband in his lifetime had purchased for her use a semi-detached
villa in the same long, straight road whereon the church and
parsonage faced, which was to be hers as long as she chose to
live in it.&nbsp; Here she now resided, looking out upon the
fragment of lawn in front, and through the railings at the
ever-flowing traffic; or, bending forward over the window-sill on
the first floor, stretching her eyes far up and down the vista of
sooty trees, hazy air, and drab house-fa&ccedil;ades, along which
echoed the noises common to a suburban main thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Somehow, her boy, with his aristocratic school-knowledge, his
grammars, and his aversions, was losing those wide infantine
sympathies, extending as far as to the sun and moon themselves,
with which he, like other children, had been born, and which his
mother, a child of nature herself, had loved in him; he was
reducing their compass to a population of a few thousand wealthy
and titled people, the mere veneer of a thousand million or so of
others who did not interest him at all.&nbsp; He drifted further
and further away from her.&nbsp; Sophy&rsquo;s <i>milieu</i>
being a suburb of minor tradesmen and under-clerks, and her
almost only companions the two servants of her own house, it was
not surprising that after her husband&rsquo;s death she soon lost
the little artificial tastes she had acquired from him, and
became&mdash;in her son&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;a mother whose
mistakes and origin it was his painful lot as a gentleman to
blush for.&nbsp; As yet he was far from being man enough&mdash;if
he ever would be&mdash;to rate these sins of hers at their true
infinitesimal value beside the yearning fondness that welled up
and remained penned in her heart till it should be more fully
accepted by him, or by some other person or thing.&nbsp; If he
had lived at home with her he would have had all of it; but he
seemed to require so very little in present circumstances, and it
remained stored.</p>
<p>Her life became insupportably dreary; she could not take
walks, and had no interest in going for drives, or, indeed, in
travelling anywhere.&nbsp; Nearly two years passed without an
event, and still she looked on that suburban road, thinking of
the village in which she had been born, and whither she would
have gone back&mdash;O how gladly!&mdash;even to work in the
fields.</p>
<p>Taking no exercise, she often could not sleep, and would rise
in the night or early morning and look out upon the then vacant
thoroughfare, where the lamps stood like sentinels waiting for
some procession to go by.&nbsp; An approximation to such a
procession was indeed made early every morning about one
o&rsquo;clock, when the country vehicles passed up with loads of
vegetables for Covent Garden market.&nbsp; She often saw them
creeping along at this silent and dusky hour&mdash;waggon after
waggon, bearing green bastions of cabbages nodding to their fall,
yet never falling, walls of baskets enclosing masses of beans and
peas, pyramids of snow-white turnips, swaying howdahs of mixed
produce&mdash;creeping along behind aged night-horses, who seemed
ever patiently wondering between their hollow coughs why they had
always to work at that still hour when all other sentient
creatures were privileged to rest.&nbsp; Wrapped in a cloak, it
was soothing to watch and sympathize with them when depression
and nervousness hindered sleep, and to see how the fresh
green-stuff brightened to life as it came opposite the lamp, and
how the sweating animals steamed and shone with their miles of
travel.</p>
<p>They had an interest, almost a charm, for Sophy, these
semirural people and vehicles moving in an urban atmosphere,
leading a life quite distinct from that of the daytime toilers on
the same road.&nbsp; One morning a man who accompanied a
waggon-load of potatoes gazed rather hard at the house-fronts as
he passed, and with a curious emotion she thought his form was
familiar to her.&nbsp; She looked out for him again.&nbsp; His
being an old-fashioned conveyance, with a yellow front, it was
easily recognizable, and on the third night after she saw it a
second time.&nbsp; The man alongside was, as she had fancied, Sam
Hobson, formerly gardener at Gaymead, who would at one time have
married her.</p>
<p>She had occasionally thought of him, and wondered if life in a
cottage with him would not have been a happier lot than the life
she had accepted.&nbsp; She had not thought of him passionately,
but her now dismal situation lent an interest to his
resurrection&mdash;a tender interest which it is impossible to
exaggerate.&nbsp; She went back to bed, and began thinking.&nbsp;
When did these market-gardeners, who travelled up to town so
regularly at one or two in the morning, come back?&nbsp; She
dimly recollected seeing their empty waggons, hardly noticeable
amid the ordinary day-traffic, passing down at some hour before
noon.</p>
<p>It was only April, but that morning, after breakfast, she had
the window opened, and sat looking out, the feeble sun shining
full upon her.&nbsp; She affected to sew, but her eyes never left
the street.&nbsp; Between ten and eleven the desired waggon, now
unladen, reappeared on its return journey.&nbsp; But Sam was not
looking round him then, and drove on in a reverie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sam!&rsquo; cried she.</p>
<p>Turning with a start, his face lighted up.&nbsp; He called to
him a little boy to hold the horse, alighted, and came and stood
under her window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t come down easily, Sam, or I would!&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you know I lived here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mrs. Twycott, I knew you lived along here
somewhere.&nbsp; I have often looked out for
&rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He briefly explained his own presence on the scene.&nbsp; He
had long since given up his gardening in the village near
Aldbrickham, and was now manager at a market-gardener&rsquo;s on
the south side of London, it being part of his duty to go up to
Covent Garden with waggon-loads of produce two or three times a
week.&nbsp; In answer to her curious inquiry, he admitted that he
had come to this particular district because he had seen in the
Aldbrickham paper, a year or two before, the announcement of the
death in South London of the aforetime vicar of Gaymead, which
had revived an interest in her dwelling-place that he could not
extinguish, leading him to hover about the locality till his
present post had been secured.</p>
<p>They spoke of their native village in dear old North Wessex,
the spots in which they had played together as children.&nbsp;
She tried to feel that she was a dignified personage now, that
she must not be too confidential with Sam.&nbsp; But she could
not keep it up, and the tears hanging in her eyes were indicated
in her voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not happy, Mrs. Twycott, I&rsquo;m
afraid?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, of course not!&nbsp; I lost my husband only the year
before last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I meant in another way.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d
like to be home again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is my home&mdash;for life.&nbsp; The house belongs
to me.&nbsp; But I understand&rsquo;&mdash;She let it out
then.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, Sam.&nbsp; I long for
home&mdash;<i>our</i> home!&nbsp; I <i>should</i> like to be
there, and never leave it, and die there.&rsquo;&nbsp; But she
remembered herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s only a momentary
feeling.&nbsp; I have a son, you know, a dear boy.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s at school now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somewhere handy, I suppose?&nbsp; I see there&rsquo;s
lots on &rsquo;em along this road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&nbsp; Not in one of these wretched holes!&nbsp;
At a public school&mdash;one of the most distinguished in
England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chok&rsquo; it all! of course!&nbsp; I forget,
ma&rsquo;am, that you&rsquo;ve been a lady for so many
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I am not a lady,&rsquo; she said sadly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I never shall be.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s a gentleman, and
that&mdash;makes it&mdash;O how difficult for me!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>The acquaintance thus oddly reopened proceeded apace.&nbsp;
She often looked out to get a few words with him, by night or by
day.&nbsp; Her sorrow was that she could not accompany her one
old friend on foot a little way, and talk more freely than she
could do while he paused before the house.&nbsp; One night, at
the beginning of June, when she was again on the watch after an
absence of some days from the window, he entered the gate and
said softly, &lsquo;Now, wouldn&rsquo;t some air do you
good?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve only half a load this morning.&nbsp; Why
not ride up to Covent Garden with me?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a nice
seat on the cabbages, where I&rsquo;ve spread a sack.&nbsp; You
can be home again in a cab before anybody is up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She refused at first, and then, trembling with excitement,
hastily finished her dressing, and wrapped herself up in cloak
and veil, afterwards sidling downstairs by the aid of the
handrail, in a way she could adopt on an emergency.&nbsp; When
she had opened the door she found Sam on the step, and he lifted
her bodily on his strong arm across the little forecourt into his
vehicle.&nbsp; Not a soul was visible or audible in the infinite
length of the straight, flat highway, with its ever-waiting lamps
converging to points in each direction.&nbsp; The air was fresh
as country air at this hour, and the stars shone, except to the
north-eastward, where there was a whitish light&mdash;the
dawn.&nbsp; Sam carefully placed her in the seat, and drove
on.</p>
<p>They talked as they had talked in old days, Sam pulling
himself up now and then, when he thought himself too
familiar.&nbsp; More than once she said with misgiving that she
wondered if she ought to have indulged in the freak.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I am so lonely in my house,&rsquo; she added,
&lsquo;and this makes me so happy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must come again, dear Mrs. Twycott.&nbsp; There is
no time o&rsquo; day for taking the air like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It grew lighter and lighter.&nbsp; The sparrows became busy in
the streets, and the city waxed denser around them.&nbsp; When
they approached the river it was day, and on the bridge they
beheld the full blaze of morning sunlight in the direction of St.
Paul&rsquo;s, the river glistening towards it, and not a craft
stirring.</p>
<p>Near Covent Garden he put her into a cab, and they parted,
looking into each other&rsquo;s faces like the very old friends
they were.&nbsp; She reached home without adventure, limped to
the door, and let herself in with her latch-key unseen.</p>
<p>The air and Sam&rsquo;s presence had revived her: her cheeks
were quite pink&mdash;almost beautiful.&nbsp; She had something
to live for in addition to her son.&nbsp; A woman of pure
instincts, she knew there had been nothing really wrong in the
journey, but supposed it conventionally to be very wrong
indeed.</p>
<p>Soon, however, she gave way to the temptation of going with
him again, and on this occasion their conversation was distinctly
tender, and Sam said he never should forget her, notwithstanding
that she had served him rather badly at one time.&nbsp; After
much hesitation he told her of a plan it was in his power to
carry out, and one he should like to take in hand, since he did
not care for London work: it was to set up as a master
greengrocer down at Aldbrickham, the county-town of their native
place.&nbsp; He knew of an opening&mdash;a shop kept by aged
people who wished to retire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why don&rsquo;t you do it, then, Sam?&rsquo; she
asked with a slight heartsinking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I&rsquo;m not sure if&mdash;you&rsquo;d join
me.&nbsp; I know you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
Such a lady as ye&rsquo;ve been so long, you couldn&rsquo;t be a
wife to a man like me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly suppose I could!&rsquo; she assented, also
frightened at the idea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you could,&rsquo; he said eagerly,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;d on&rsquo;y have to sit in the back parlour and
look through the glass partition when I was away
sometimes&mdash;just to keep an eye on things.&nbsp; The lameness
wouldn&rsquo;t hinder that . . . I&rsquo;d keep you as genteel as
ever I could, dear Sophy&mdash;if I might think of it!&rsquo; he
pleaded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sam, I&rsquo;ll be frank,&rsquo; she said, putting her
hand on his.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it were only myself I would do it,
and gladly, though everything I possess would be lost to me by
marrying again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s more
independent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s good of you, dear, dear Sam.&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s something else.&nbsp; I have a son . . . I almost
fancy when I am miserable sometimes that he is not really mine,
but one I hold in trust for my late husband.&nbsp; He seems to
belong so little to me personally, so entirely to his dead
father.&nbsp; He is so much educated and I so little that I do
not feel dignified enough to be his mother . . . Well, he would
have to be told.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Unquestionably.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sam saw her
thought and her fear.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still, you can do as you like,
Sophy&mdash;Mrs. Twycott,&rsquo; he added.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not
you who are the child, but he.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; Sam, if I could, I
would marry you, some day.&nbsp; But you must wait a while, and
let me think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was enough for him, and he was blithe at their
parting.&nbsp; Not so she.&nbsp; To tell Randolph seemed
impossible.&nbsp; She could wait till he had gone up to Oxford,
when what she did would affect his life but little.&nbsp; But
would he ever tolerate the idea?&nbsp; And if not, could she defy
him?</p>
<p>She had not told him a word when the yearly cricket-match came
on at Lord&rsquo;s between the public schools, though Sam had
already gone back to Aldbrickham.&nbsp; Mrs. Twycott felt
stronger than usual: she went to the match with Randolph, and was
able to leave her chair and walk about occasionally.&nbsp; The
bright idea occurred to her that she could casually broach the
subject while moving round among the spectators, when the
boy&rsquo;s spirits were high with interest in the game, and he
would weigh domestic matters as feathers in the scale beside the
day&rsquo;s victory.&nbsp; They promenaded under the lurid July
sun, this pair, so wide apart, yet so near, and Sophy saw the
large proportion of boys like her own, in their broad white
collars and dwarf hats, and all around the rows of great coaches
under which was jumbled the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of luxurious
luncheons; bones, pie-crusts, champagne-bottles, glasses, plates,
napkins, and the family silver; while on the coaches sat the
proud fathers and mothers; but never a poor mother like
her.&nbsp; If Randolph had not appertained to these, had not
centred all his interests in them, had not cared exclusively for
the class they belonged to, how happy would things have
been!&nbsp; A great huzza at some small performance with the bat
burst from the multitude of relatives, and Randolph jumped wildly
into the air to see what had happened.&nbsp; Sophy fetched up the
sentence that had been already shaped; but she could not get it
out.&nbsp; The occasion was, perhaps, an inopportune one.&nbsp;
The contrast between her story and the display of fashion to
which Randolph had grown to regard himself as akin would be
fatal.&nbsp; She awaited a better time.</p>
<p>It was on an evening when they were alone in their plain
suburban residence, where life was not blue but brown, that she
ultimately broke silence, qualifying her announcement of a
probable second marriage by assuring him that it would not take
place for a long time to come, when he would be living quite
independently of her.</p>
<p>The boy thought the idea a very reasonable one, and asked if
she had chosen anybody?&nbsp; She hesitated; and he seemed to
have a misgiving.&nbsp; He hoped his stepfather would be a
gentleman? he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not what you call a gentleman,&rsquo; she answered
timidly.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be much as I was before I knew
your father;&rsquo; and by degrees she acquainted him with the
whole.&nbsp; The youth&rsquo;s face remained fixed for a moment;
then he flushed, leant on the table, and burst into passionate
tears.</p>
<p>His mother went up to him, kissed all of his face that she
could get at, and patted his back as if he were still the baby he
once had been, crying herself the while.&nbsp; When he had
somewhat recovered from his paroxysm he went hastily to his own
room and fastened the door.</p>
<p>Parleyings were attempted through the keyhole, outside which
she waited and listened.&nbsp; It was long before he would reply,
and when he did it was to say sternly at her from within:
&lsquo;I am ashamed of you!&nbsp; It will ruin me!&nbsp; A
miserable boor! a churl! a clown!&nbsp; It will degrade me in the
eyes of all the gentlemen of England!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say no more&mdash;perhaps I am wrong!&nbsp; I will
struggle against it!&rsquo; she cried miserably.</p>
<p>Before Randolph left her that summer a letter arrived from Sam
to inform her that he had been unexpectedly fortunate in
obtaining the shop.&nbsp; He was in possession; it was the
largest in the town, combining fruit with vegetables, and he
thought it would form a home worthy even of her some day.&nbsp;
Might he not run up to town to see her?</p>
<p>She met him by stealth, and said he must still wait for her
final answer.&nbsp; The autumn dragged on, and when Randolph was
home at Christmas for the holidays she broached the matter
again.&nbsp; But the young gentleman was inexorable.</p>
<p>It was dropped for months; renewed again; abandoned under his
repugnance; again attempted; and thus the gentle creature
reasoned and pleaded till four or five long years had
passed.&nbsp; Then the faithful Sam revived his suit with some
peremptoriness.&nbsp; Sophy&rsquo;s son, now an undergraduate,
was down from Oxford one Easter, when she again opened the
subject.&nbsp; As soon as he was ordained, she argued, he would
have a home of his own, wherein she, with her bad grammar and her
ignorance, would be an encumbrance to him.&nbsp; Better
obliterate her as much as possible.</p>
<p>He showed a more manly anger now, but would not agree.&nbsp;
She on her side was more persistent, and he had doubts whether
she could be trusted in his absence.&nbsp; But by indignation and
contempt for her taste he completely maintained his ascendency;
and finally taking her before a little cross and altar that he
had erected in his bedroom for his private devotions, there bade
her kneel, and swear that she would not wed Samuel Hobson without
his consent.&nbsp; &lsquo;I owe this to my father!&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The poor woman swore, thinking he would soften as soon as he
was ordained and in full swing of clerical work.&nbsp; But he did
not.&nbsp; His education had by this time sufficiently ousted his
humanity to keep him quite firm; though his mother might have led
an idyllic life with her faithful fruiterer and greengrocer, and
nobody have been anything the worse in the world.</p>
<p>Her lameness became more confirmed as time went on, and she
seldom or never left the house in the long southern thoroughfare,
where she seemed to be pining her heart away.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why
mayn&rsquo;t I say to Sam that I&rsquo;ll marry him?&nbsp; Why
mayn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; she would murmur plaintively to herself
when nobody was near.</p>
<p>Some four years after this date a middle-aged man was standing
at the door of the largest fruiterer&rsquo;s shop in
Aldbrickham.&nbsp; He was the proprietor, but to-day, instead of
his usual business attire, he wore a neat suit of black; and his
window was partly shuttered.&nbsp; From the railway-station a
funeral procession was seen approaching: it passed his door and
went out of the town towards the village of Gaymead.&nbsp; The
man, whose eyes were wet, held his hat in his hand as the
vehicles moved by; while from the mourning coach a young
smooth-shaven priest in a high waistcoat looked black as a cloud
at the shop keeper standing there.</p>

<h2>FOR CONSCIENCE&rsquo; SAKE</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>Whether the utilitarian or the intuitive theory of the moral
sense be upheld, it is beyond question that there are a few
subtle-souled persons with whom the absolute gratuitousness of an
act of reparation is an inducement to perform it; while
exhortation as to its necessity would breed excuses for leaving
it undone.&nbsp; The case of Mr. Millborne and Mrs. Frankland
particularly illustrated this, and perhaps something more.</p>
<p>There were few figures better known to the local
crossing-sweeper than Mr. Millborne&rsquo;s, in his daily comings
and goings along a familiar and quiet London street, where he
lived inside the door marked eleven, though not as
householder.&nbsp; In age he was fifty at least, and his habits
were as regular as those of a person can be who has no occupation
but the study of how to keep himself employed.&nbsp; He turned
almost always to the right on getting to the end of his street,
then he went onward down Bond Street to his club, whence he
returned by precisely the same course about six o&rsquo;clock, on
foot; or, if he went to dine, later on in a cab.&nbsp; He was
known to be a man of some means, though apparently not
wealthy.&nbsp; Being a bachelor he seemed to prefer his present
mode of living as a lodger in Mrs. Towney&rsquo;s best rooms,
with the use of furniture which he had bought ten times over in
rent during his tenancy, to having a house of his own.</p>
<p>None among his acquaintance tried to know him well, for his
manner and moods did not excite curiosity or deep
friendship.&nbsp; He was not a man who seemed to have anything on
his mind, anything to conceal, anything to impart.&nbsp; From his
casual remarks it was generally understood that he was
country-born, a native of some place in Wessex; that he had come
to London as a young man in a banking-house, and had risen to a
post of responsibility; when, by the death of his father, who had
been fortunate in his investments, the son succeeded to an income
which led him to retire from a business life somewhat early.</p>
<p>One evening, when he had been unwell for several days, Doctor
Bindon came in, after dinner, from the adjoining medical quarter,
and smoked with him over the fire.&nbsp; The patient&rsquo;s
ailment was not such as to require much thought, and they talked
together on indifferent subjects.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a lonely man, Bindon&mdash;a lonely man,&rsquo;
Millborne took occasion to say, shaking his head gloomily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know such loneliness as mine . . . And the
older I get the more I am dissatisfied with myself.&nbsp; And
to-day I have been, through an accident, more than usually
haunted by what, above all other events of my life, causes that
dissatisfaction&mdash;the recollection of an unfulfilled promise
made twenty years ago.&nbsp; In ordinary affairs I have always
been considered a man of my word and perhaps it is on that
account that a particular vow I once made, and did not keep,
comes back to me with a magnitude out of all proportion (I
daresay) to its real gravity, especially at this time of
day.&nbsp; You know the discomfort caused at night by the
half-sleeping sense that a door or window has been left
unfastened, or in the day by the remembrance of unanswered
letters.&nbsp; So does that promise haunt me from time to time,
and has done to-day particularly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and they smoked on.&nbsp; Millborne&rsquo;s
eyes, though fixed on the fire, were really regarding attentively
a town in the West of England.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;I have never quite
forgotten it, though during the busy years of my life it was
shelved and buried under the pressure of my pursuits.&nbsp; And,
as I say, to-day in particular, an incident in the law-report of
a somewhat similar kind has brought it back again vividly.&nbsp;
However, what it was I can tell you in a few words, though no
doubt you, as a man of the world, will smile at the thinness of
my skin when you hear it . . . I came up to town at
one-and-twenty, from Toneborough, in Outer Wessex, where I was
born, and where, before I left, I had won the heart of a young
woman of my own age.&nbsp; I promised her marriage, took
advantage of my promise, and&mdash;am a bachelor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I left the place, and thought at the time I had done a
very clever thing in getting so easily out of an
entanglement.&nbsp; But I have lived long enough for that promise
to return to bother me&mdash;to be honest, not altogether as a
pricking of the conscience, but as a dissatisfaction with myself
as a specimen of the heap of flesh called humanity.&nbsp; If I
were to ask you to lend me fifty pounds, which I would repay you
next midsummer, and I did not repay you, I should consider myself
a shabby sort of fellow, especially if you wanted the money
badly.&nbsp; Yet I promised that girl just as distinctly; and
then coolly broke my word, as if doing so were rather smart
conduct than a mean action, for which the poor victim herself,
encumbered with a child, and not I, had really to pay the
penalty, in spite of certain pecuniary aid that was given.&nbsp;
There, that&rsquo;s the retrospective trouble that I am always
unearthing; and you may hardly believe that though so many years
have elapsed, and it is all gone by and done with, and she must
be getting on for an old woman now, as I am for an old man, it
really often destroys my sense of self-respect still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I can understand it.&nbsp; All depends upon the
temperament.&nbsp; Thousands of men would have forgotten all
about it; so would you, perhaps, if you had married and had a
family.&nbsp; Did she ever marry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&nbsp; O no&mdash;she never
did.&nbsp; She left Toneborough, and later on appeared under
another name at Exonbury, in the next county, where she was not
known.&nbsp; It is very seldom that I go down into that part of
the country, but in passing through Exonbury, on one occasion, I
learnt that she was quite a settled resident there, as a teacher
of music, or something of the kind.&nbsp; That much I casually
heard when I was there two or three years ago.&nbsp; But I have
never set eyes on her since our original acquaintance, and should
not know her if I met her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did the child live?&rsquo; asked the doctor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For several years, certainly,&rsquo; replied his
friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot say if she is living now.&nbsp; It
was a little girl.&nbsp; She might be married by this time as far
as years go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the mother&mdash;was she a decent, worthy young
woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes; a sensible, quiet girl, neither attractive nor
unattractive to the ordinary observer; simply commonplace.&nbsp;
Her position at the time of our acquaintance was not so good as
mine.&nbsp; My father was a solicitor, as I think I have told
you.&nbsp; She was a young girl in a music-shop; and it was
represented to me that it would be beneath my position to marry
her.&nbsp; Hence the result.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, all I can say is that after twenty years it is
probably too late to think of mending such a matter.&nbsp; It has
doubtless by this time mended itself.&nbsp; You had better
dismiss it from your mind as an evil past your control.&nbsp; Of
course, if mother and daughter are alive, or either, you might
settle something upon them, if you were inclined, and had it to
spare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t much to spare; and I have
relations in narrow circumstances&mdash;perhaps narrower than
theirs.&nbsp; But that is not the point.&nbsp; Were I ever so
rich I feel I could not rectify the past by money.&nbsp; I did
not promise to enrich her.&nbsp; On the contrary, I told her it
would probably be dire poverty for both of us.&nbsp; But I did
promise to make her my wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then find her and do it,&rsquo; said the doctor
jocularly as he rose to leave.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, Bindon.&nbsp; That, of course, is the obvious
jest.&nbsp; But I haven&rsquo;t the slightest desire for
marriage; I am quite content to live as I have lived.&nbsp; I am
a bachelor by nature, and instinct, and habit, and
everything.&nbsp; Besides, though I respect her still (for she
was not an atom to blame), I haven&rsquo;t any shadow of love for
her.&nbsp; In my mind she exists as one of those women you think
well of, but find uninteresting.&nbsp; It would be purely with
the idea of putting wrong right that I should hunt her up, and
propose to do it off-hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t think of it seriously?&rsquo; said his
surprised friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sometimes think that I would, if it were practicable;
simply, as I say, to recover my sense of being a man of
honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you luck in the enterprise,&rsquo; said Doctor
Bindon.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll soon be out of that chair, and
then you can put your impulse to the test.&nbsp; But&mdash;after
twenty years of silence&mdash;I should say,
don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s advice remained counterpoised, in
Millborne&rsquo;s mind, by the aforesaid mood of seriousness and
sense of principle, approximating often to religious sentiment,
which had been evolving itself in his breast for months, and even
years.</p>
<p>The feeling, however, had no immediate effect upon Mr.
Millborne&rsquo;s actions.&nbsp; He soon got over his trifling
illness, and was vexed with himself for having, in a moment of
impulse, confided such a case of conscience to anybody.</p>
<p>But the force which had prompted it, though latent, remained
with him and ultimately grew stronger.&nbsp; The upshot was that
about four months after the date of his illness and disclosure,
Millborne found himself on a mild spring morning at Paddington
Station, in a train that was starting for the west.&nbsp; His
many intermittent thoughts on his broken promise from time to
time, in those hours when loneliness brought him face to face
with his own personality, had at last resulted in this
course.</p>
<p>The decisive stimulus had been given when, a day or two
earlier, on looking into a Post-Office Directory, he learnt that
the woman he had not met for twenty years was still living on at
Exonbury under the name she had assumed when, a year or two after
her disappearance from her native town and his, she had returned
from abroad as a young widow with a child, and taken up her
residence at the former city.&nbsp; Her condition was apparently
but little changed, and her daughter seemed to be with her, their
names standing in the Directory as &lsquo;Mrs. Leonora Frankland
and Miss Frankland, Teachers of Music and Dancing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Millborne reached Exonbury in the afternoon, and his first
business, before even taking his luggage into the town, was to
find the house occupied by the teachers.&nbsp; Standing in a
central and open place it was not difficult to discover, a
well-burnished brass doorplate bearing their names
prominently.&nbsp; He hesitated to enter without further
knowledge, and ultimately took lodgings over a toyshop opposite,
securing a sitting-room which faced a similar drawing or
sitting-room at the Franklands&rsquo;, where the dancing lessons
were given.&nbsp; Installed here he was enabled to make
indirectly, and without suspicion, inquiries and observations on
the character of the ladies over the way, which he did with much
deliberateness.</p>
<p>He learnt that the widow, Mrs. Frankland, with her one
daughter, Frances, was of cheerful and excellent repute,
energetic and painstaking with her pupils, of whom she had a good
many, and in whose tuition her daughter assisted her.&nbsp; She
was quite a recognized townswoman, and though the dancing branch
of her profession was perhaps a trifle worldly, she was really a
serious-minded lady who, being obliged to live by what she knew
how to teach, balanced matters by lending a hand at charitable
bazaars, assisting at sacred concerts, and giving musical
recitations in aid of funds for bewildering happy savages, and
other such enthusiasms of this enlightened country.&nbsp; Her
daughter was one of the foremost of the bevy of young women who
decorated the churches at Easter and Christmas, was organist in
one of those edifices, and had subscribed to the testimonial of a
silver broth-basin that was presented to the Reverend Mr. Walker
as a token of gratitude for his faithful and arduous intonations
of six months as sub-precentor in the Cathedral.&nbsp; Altogether
mother and daughter appeared to be a typical and innocent pair
among the genteel citizens of Exonbury.</p>
<p>As a natural and simple way of advertising their profession
they allowed the windows of the music-room to be a little open,
so that you had the pleasure of hearing all along the street at
any hour between sunrise and sunset fragmentary gems of classical
music as interpreted by the young people of twelve or fourteen
who took lessons there.&nbsp; But it was said that Mrs. Frankland
made most of her income by letting out pianos on hire, and by
selling them as agent for the makers.</p>
<p>The report pleased Millborne; it was highly creditable, and
far better than he had hoped.&nbsp; He was curious to get a view
of the two women who led such blameless lives.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait to gain a glimpse of Leonora.&nbsp; It
was when she was standing on her own doorstep, opening her
parasol, on the morning after his arrival.&nbsp; She was thin,
though not gaunt; and a good, well-wearing, thoughtful face had
taken the place of the one which had temporarily attracted him in
the days of his nonage.&nbsp; She wore black, and it became her
in her character of widow.&nbsp; The daughter next appeared; she
was a smoothed and rounded copy of her mother, with the same
decision in her mien that Leonora had, and a bounding gait in
which he traced a faint resemblance to his own at her age.</p>
<p>For the first time he absolutely made up his mind to call on
them.&nbsp; But his antecedent step was to send Leonora a note
the next morning, stating his proposal to visit her, and
suggesting the evening as the time, because she seemed to be so
greatly occupied in her professional capacity during the
day.&nbsp; He purposely worded his note in such a form as not to
require an answer from her which would be possibly awkward to
write.</p>
<p>No answer came.&nbsp; Naturally he should not have been
surprised at this; and yet he felt a little checked, even though
she had only refrained from volunteering a reply that was not
demanded.</p>
<p>At eight, the hour fixed by himself, he crossed over and was
passively admitted by the servant.&nbsp; Mrs. Frankland, as she
called herself, received him in the large music-and-dancing room
on the first-floor front, and not in any private little parlour
as he had expected.&nbsp; This cast a distressingly business-like
colour over their first meeting after so many years of
severance.&nbsp; The woman he had wronged stood before him,
well-dressed, even to his metropolitan eyes, and her manner as
she came up to him was dignified even to hardness.&nbsp; She
certainly was not glad to see him.&nbsp; But what could he expect
after a neglect of twenty years!</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you do, Mr. Millborne?&rsquo; she said
cheerfully, as to any chance caller.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am obliged to
receive you here because my daughter has a friend
downstairs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your daughter&mdash;and mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;yes, yes,&rsquo; she replied hastily, as if
the addition had escaped her memory.&nbsp; &lsquo;But perhaps the
less said about that the better, in fairness to me.&nbsp; You
will consider me a widow, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, Leonora . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; He could not get
on, her manner was so cold and indifferent.&nbsp; The expected
scene of sad reproach, subdued to delicacy by the run of years,
was absent altogether.&nbsp; He was obliged to come to the point
without preamble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite free, Leonora&mdash;I mean as to
marriage?&nbsp; There is nobody who has your promise,
or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes; quite free, Mr. Millborne,&rsquo; she said,
somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I will tell you why I have come.&nbsp; Twenty
years ago I promised to make you my wife; and I am here to fulfil
that promise.&nbsp; Heaven forgive my tardiness!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her surprise was increased, but she was not agitated.&nbsp;
She seemed to become gloomy, disapproving.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could
not entertain such an idea at this time of life,&rsquo; she said
after a moment or two.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would complicate matters
too greatly.&nbsp; I have a very fair income, and require no help
of any sort.&nbsp; I have no wish to marry . . . What could have
induced you to come on such an errand now?&nbsp; It seems quite
extraordinary, if I may say so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must&mdash;I daresay it does,&rsquo; Millborne
replied vaguely; &lsquo;and I must tell you that impulse&mdash;I
mean in the sense of passion&mdash;has little to do with
it.&nbsp; I wish to marry you, Leonora; I much desire to marry
you.&nbsp; But it is an affair of conscience, a case of
fulfilment.&nbsp; I promised you, and it was dishonourable of me
to go away.&nbsp; I want to remove that sense of dishonour before
I die.&nbsp; No doubt we might get to love each other as warmly
as we did in old times?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She dubiously shook her head.&nbsp; &lsquo;I appreciate your
motives, Mr. Millborne; but you must consider my position; and
you will see that, short of the personal wish to marry, which I
don&rsquo;t feel, there is no reason why I should change my
state, even though by so doing I should ease your
conscience.&nbsp; My position in this town is a respected one; I
have built it up by my own hard labours, and, in short, I
don&rsquo;t wish to alter it.&nbsp; My daughter, too, is just on
the verge of an engagement to be married, to a young man who will
make her an excellent husband.&nbsp; It will be in every way a
desirable match for her.&nbsp; He is downstairs now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does she know&mdash;anything about me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, no; God forbid!&nbsp; Her father is dead and
buried to her.&nbsp; So that, you see, things are going on
smoothly, and I don&rsquo;t want to disturb their
progress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; he said, and rose to
go.&nbsp; At the door, however, he came back again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, Leonora,&rsquo; he urged, &lsquo;I have come on
purpose; and I don&rsquo;t see what disturbance would be
caused.&nbsp; You would simply marry an old friend.&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t you reconsider?&nbsp; It is no more than right that
we should be united, remembering the girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, and patted with her foot nervously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t detain you,&rsquo; he added.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall not be leaving Exonbury yet.&nbsp; You will allow
me to see you again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; she said
reluctantly.</p>
<p>The obstacles he had encountered, though they did not
reanimate his dead passion for Leonora, did certainly make it
appear indispensable to his peace of mind to overcome her
coldness.&nbsp; He called frequently.&nbsp; The first meeting
with the daughter was a trying ordeal, though he did not feel
drawn towards her as he had expected to be; she did not excite
his sympathies.&nbsp; Her mother confided to Frances the errand
of &lsquo;her old friend,&rsquo; which was viewed by the daughter
with strong disfavour.&nbsp; His desire being thus uncongenial to
both, for a long time Millborne made not the least impression
upon Mrs. Frankland.&nbsp; His attentions pestered her rather
than pleased her.&nbsp; He was surprised at her firmness, and it
was only when he hinted at moral reasons for their union that she
was ever shaken.&nbsp; &lsquo;Strictly speaking,&rsquo; he would
say, &lsquo;we ought, as honest persons, to marry; and
that&rsquo;s the truth of it, Leonora.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have looked at it in that light,&rsquo; she said
quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It struck me at the very first.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t see the force of the argument.&nbsp; I totally deny
that after this interval of time I am bound to marry you for
honour&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; I would have married you, as you know
well enough, at the proper time.&nbsp; But what is the use of
remedies now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were standing at the window.&nbsp; A scantly-whiskered
young man, in clerical attire, called at the door below.&nbsp;
Leonora flushed with interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is he?&rsquo; said Mr. Millborne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Frances&rsquo;s lover.&nbsp; I am so sorry&mdash;she
is not at home!&nbsp; Ah! they have told him where she is, and he
has gone to find her . . . I hope that suit will prosper, at any
rate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he cannot marry yet; and Frances sees but little
of him now he has left Exonbury.&nbsp; He was formerly doing duty
here, but now he is curate of St. John&rsquo;s, Ivell, fifty
miles up the line.&nbsp; There is a tacit agreement between them,
but&mdash;there have been friends of his who object, because of
our vocation.&nbsp; However, he sees the absurdity of such an
objection as that, and is not influenced by it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your marriage with me would help the match, instead of
hindering it, as you have said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think it would?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It certainly would, by taking you out of this business
altogether.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By chance he had found the way to move her somewhat, and he
followed it up.&nbsp; This view was imparted to Mrs.
Frankland&rsquo;s daughter, and it led her to soften her
opposition.&nbsp; Millborne, who had given up his lodging in
Exonbury, journeyed to and fro regularly, till at last he
overcame her negations, and she expressed a reluctant assent.</p>
<p>They were married at the nearest church; and the
goodwill&mdash;whatever that was&mdash;of the music-and-dancing
connection was sold to a successor only too ready to jump into
the place, the Millbornes having decided to live in London.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>Millborne was a householder in his old district, though not in
his old street, and Mrs. Millborne and their daughter had turned
themselves into Londoners.&nbsp; Frances was well reconciled to
the removal by her lover&rsquo;s satisfaction at the
change.&nbsp; It suited him better to travel from Ivell a hundred
miles to see her in London, where he frequently had other
engagements, than fifty in the opposite direction where nothing
but herself required his presence.&nbsp; So here they were,
furnished up to the attics, in one of the small but popular
streets of the West district, in a house whose front, till lately
of the complexion of a chimney-sweep, had been scraped to show to
the surprised wayfarer the bright yellow and red brick that had
lain lurking beneath the soot of fifty years.</p>
<p>The social lift that the two women had derived from the
alliance was considerable; but when the exhilaration which
accompanies a first residence in London, the sensation of
standing on a pivot of the world, had passed, their lives
promised to be somewhat duller than when, at despised Exonbury,
they had enjoyed a nodding acquaintance with three-fourths of the
town.&nbsp; Mr. Millborne did not criticise his wife; he could
not.&nbsp; Whatever defects of hardness and acidity his original
treatment and the lapse of years might have developed in her, his
sense of a realized idea, of a re-established self-satisfaction,
was always thrown into the scale on her side, and out-weighed all
objections.</p>
<p>It was about a month after their settlement in town that the
household decided to spend a week at a watering-place in the Isle
of Wight, and while there the Reverend Percival Cope (the young
curate aforesaid) came to see them, Frances in particular.&nbsp;
No formal engagement of the young pair had been announced as yet,
but it was clear that their mutual understanding could not end in
anything but marriage without grievous disappointment to one of
the parties at least.&nbsp; Not that Frances was
sentimental.&nbsp; She was rather of the imperious sort, indeed;
and, to say all, the young girl had not fulfilled her
father&rsquo;s expectations of her.&nbsp; But he hoped and worked
for her welfare as sincerely as any father could do.</p>
<p>Mr. Cope was introduced to the new head of the family, and
stayed with them in the Island two or three days.&nbsp; On the
last day of his visit they decided to venture on a two
hours&rsquo; sail in one of the small yachts which lay there for
hire.&nbsp; The trip had not progressed far before all, except
the curate, found that sailing in a breeze did not quite agree
with them; but as he seemed to enjoy the experience, the other
three bore their condition as well as they could without grimace
or complaint, till the young man, observing their discomfort,
gave immediate directions to tack about.&nbsp; On the way back to
port they sat silent, facing each other.</p>
<p>Nausea in such circumstances, like midnight watching, fatigue,
trouble, fright, has this marked effect upon the countenance,
that it often brings out strongly the divergences of the
individual from the norm of his race, accentuating superficial
peculiarities to radical distinctions.&nbsp; Unexpected
physiognomies will uncover themselves at these times in
well-known faces; the aspect becomes invested with the spectral
presence of entombed and forgotten ancestors; and family
lineaments of special or exclusive cast, which in ordinary
moments are masked by a stereotyped expression and mien, start up
with crude insistence to the view.</p>
<p>Frances, sitting beside her mother&rsquo;s husband, with Mr.
Cope opposite, was naturally enough much regarded by the curate
during the tedious sail home; at first with sympathetic
smiles.&nbsp; Then, as the middle-aged father and his child grew
each gray-faced, as the pretty blush of Frances disintegrated
into spotty stains, and the soft rotundities of her features
diverged from their familiar and reposeful beauty into elemental
lines, Cope was gradually struck with the resemblance between a
pair in their discomfort who in their ease presented nothing to
the eye in common.&nbsp; Mr. Millborne and Frances in their
indisposition were strangely, startlingly alike.</p>
<p>The inexplicable fact absorbed Cope&rsquo;s attention
quite.&nbsp; He forgot to smile at Frances, to hold her hand; and
when they touched the shore he remained sitting for some moments
like a man in a trance.</p>
<p>As they went homeward, and recovered their complexions and
contours, the similarities one by one disappeared, and Frances
and Mr. Millborne were again masked by the commonplace
differences of sex and age.&nbsp; It was as if, during the
voyage, a mysterious veil had been lifted, temporarily revealing
a strange pantomime of the past.</p>
<p>During the evening he said to her casually: &lsquo;Is your
step-father a cousin of your mother, dear Frances?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no
relationship.&nbsp; He was only an old friend of hers.&nbsp; Why
did you suppose such a thing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did not explain, and the next morning started to resume his
duties at Ivell.</p>
<p>Cope was an honest young fellow, and shrewd withal.&nbsp; At
home in his quiet rooms in St. Peter&rsquo;s Street, Ivell, he
pondered long and unpleasantly on the revelations of the
cruise.&nbsp; The tale it told was distinct enough, and for the
first time his position was an uncomfortable one.&nbsp; He had
met the Franklands at Exonbury as parishioners, had been
attracted by Frances, and had floated thus far into an engagement
which was indefinite only because of his inability to marry just
yet.&nbsp; The Franklands&rsquo; past had apparently contained
mysteries, and it did not coincide with his judgment to marry
into a family whose mystery was of the sort suggested.&nbsp; So
he sat and sighed, between his reluctance to lose Frances and his
natural dislike of forming a connection with people whose
antecedents would not bear the strictest investigation.</p>
<p>A passionate lover of the old-fashioned sort might possibly
never have halted to weigh these doubts; but though he was in the
church Cope&rsquo;s affections were fastidious&mdash;distinctly
tempered with the alloys of the century&rsquo;s decadence.&nbsp;
He delayed writing to Frances for some while, simply because he
could not tune himself up to enthusiasm when worried by
suspicions of such a kind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Millbornes had returned to London, and Frances
was growing anxious.&nbsp; In talking to her mother of Cope she
had innocently alluded to his curious inquiry if her mother and
her step-father were connected by any tie of cousinship.&nbsp;
Mrs. Millborne made her repeat the words.&nbsp; Frances did so,
and watched with inquisitive eyes their effect upon her
elder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is there so startling in his inquiry then?&rsquo;
she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can it have anything to do with his not
writing to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her mother flinched, but did not inform her, and Frances also
was now drawn within the atmosphere of suspicion.&nbsp; That
night when standing by chance outside the chamber of her parents
she heard for the first time their voices engaged in a sharp
altercation.</p>
<p>The apple of discord had, indeed, been dropped into the house
of the Millbornes.&nbsp; The scene within the chamber-door was
Mrs. Millborne standing before her dressing-table, looking across
to her husband in the dressing-room adjoining, where he was
sitting down, his eyes fixed on the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you come and disturb my life a second
time?&rsquo; she harshly asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did you pester
me with your conscience, till I was driven to accept you to get
rid of your importunity?&nbsp; Frances and I were doing well: the
one desire of my life was that she should marry that good young
man.&nbsp; And now the match is broken off by your cruel
interference!&nbsp; Why did you show yourself in my world again,
and raise this scandal upon my hard-won respectability&mdash;won
by such weary years of labour as none will ever
know!&rsquo;&nbsp; She bent her face upon the table and wept
passionately.</p>
<p>There was no reply from Mr. Millborne.&nbsp; Frances lay awake
nearly all that night, and when at breakfast-time the next
morning still no letter appeared from Mr. Cope, she entreated her
mother to go to Ivell and see if the young man were ill.</p>
<p>Mrs. Millborne went, returning the same day.&nbsp; Frances,
anxious and haggard, met her at the station.</p>
<p>Was all well?&nbsp; Her mother could not say it was; though he
was not ill.</p>
<p>One thing she had found out, that it was a mistake to hunt up
a man when his inclinations were to hold aloof.&nbsp; Returning
with her mother in the cab Frances insisted upon knowing what the
mystery was which plainly had alienated her lover.&nbsp; The
precise words which had been spoken at the interview with him
that day at Ivell Mrs. Millborne could not be induced to repeat;
but thus far she admitted, that the estrangement was
fundamentally owing to Mr. Millborne having sought her out and
married her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why did he seek you out&mdash;and why were you
obliged to marry him?&rsquo; asked the distressed girl.&nbsp;
Then the evidences pieced themselves together in her acute mind,
and, her colour gradually rising, she asked her mother if what
they pointed to was indeed the fact.&nbsp; Her mother admitted
that it was.</p>
<p>A flush of mortification succeeded to the flush of shame upon
the young woman&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; How could a scrupulously
correct clergyman and lover like Mr. Cope ask her to be his wife
after this discovery of her irregular birth?&nbsp; She covered
her eyes with her hands in a silent despair.</p>
<p>In the presence of Mr. Millborne they at first suppressed
their anguish.&nbsp; But by and by their feelings got the better
of them, and when he was asleep in his chair after dinner Mrs.
Millborne&rsquo;s irritation broke out.&nbsp; The embittered
Frances joined her in reproaching the man who had come as the
spectre to their intended feast of Hymen, and turned its promise
to ghastly failure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why were you so weak, mother, as to admit such an enemy
to your house&mdash;one so obviously your evil genius&mdash;much
less accept him as a husband, after so long?&nbsp; If you had
only told me all, I could have advised you better!&nbsp; But I
suppose I have no right to reproach him, bitter as I feel, and
even though he has blighted my life for ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frances, I did hold out; I saw it was a mistake to have
any more to say to a man who had been such an unmitigated curse
to me!&nbsp; But he would not listen; he kept on about his
conscience and mine, till I was bewildered, and said Yes! . . .
Bringing us away from a quiet town where we were known and
respected&mdash;what an ill-considered thing it was!&nbsp; O the
content of those days!&nbsp; We had society there, people in our
own position, who did not expect more of us than we expected of
them.&nbsp; Here, where there is so much, there is nothing!&nbsp;
He said London society was so bright and brilliant that it would
be like a new world.&nbsp; It may be to those who are in it; but
what is that to us two lonely women; we only see it flashing
past! . . . O the fool, the fool that I was!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now Millborne was not so soundly asleep as to prevent his
hearing these animadversions that were almost execrations, and
many more of the same sort.&nbsp; As there was no peace for him
at home, he went again to his club, where, since his reunion with
Leonora, he had seldom if ever been seen.&nbsp; But the shadow of
the troubles in his household interfered with his comfort here
also; he could not, as formerly, settle down into his favourite
chair with the evening paper, reposeful in the celibate&rsquo;s
sense that where he was his world&rsquo;s centre had its
fixture.&nbsp; His world was now an ellipse, with a dual
centrality, of which his own was not the major.</p>
<p>The young curate of Ivell still held aloof, tantalizing
Frances by his elusiveness.&nbsp; Plainly he was waiting upon
events.&nbsp; Millborne bore the reproaches of his wife and
daughter almost in silence; but by degrees he grew meditative, as
if revolving a new idea.&nbsp; The bitter cry about blighting
their existence at length became so impassioned that one day
Millborne calmly proposed to return again to the country; not
necessarily to Exonbury, but, if they were willing, to a little
old manor-house which he had found was to be let, standing a mile
from Mr. Cope&rsquo;s town of Ivell.</p>
<p>They were surprised, and, despite their view of him as the
bringer of ill, were disposed to accede.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though I
suppose,&rsquo; said Mrs. Millborne to him, &lsquo;it will end in
Mr. Cope&rsquo;s asking you flatly about the past, and your being
compelled to tell him; which may dash all my hopes for
Frances.&nbsp; She gets more and more like you every day,
particularly when she is in a bad temper.&nbsp; People will see
you together, and notice it; and I don&rsquo;t know what may come
of it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think they will see us together,&rsquo;
he said; but he entered into no argument when she insisted
otherwise.&nbsp; The removal was eventually resolved on; the
town-house was disposed of; and again came the invasion by
furniture-men and vans, till all the movables and servants were
whisked away.&nbsp; He sent his wife and daughter to an hotel
while this was going on, taking two or three journeys himself to
Ivell to superintend the refixing, and the improvement of the
grounds.&nbsp; When all was done he returned to them in town.</p>
<p>The house was ready for their reception, he told them, and
there only remained the journey.&nbsp; He accompanied them and
their personal luggage to the station only, having, he said, to
remain in town a short time on business with his lawyer.&nbsp;
They went, dubious and discontented&mdash;for the much-loved Cope
had made no sign.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If we were going down to live here alone,&rsquo; said
Mrs Millborne to her daughter in the train; &lsquo;and there was
no intrusive tell-tale presence! . . . But let it be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The house was a lovely little place in a grove of elms, and
they liked it much.&nbsp; The first person to call upon them as
new residents was Mr. Cope.&nbsp; He was delighted to find that
they had come so near, and (though he did not say this) meant to
live in such excellent style.&nbsp; He had not, however, resumed
the manner of a lover.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your father spoils all!&rsquo; murmured Mrs.
Millborne.</p>
<p>But three days later she received a letter from her husband,
which caused her no small degree of astonishment.&nbsp; It was
written from Boulogne.</p>
<p>It began with a long explanation of settlements of his
property, in which he had been engaged since their
departure.&nbsp; The chief feature in the business was that Mrs.
Millborne found herself the absolute owner of a comfortable sum
in personal estate, and Frances of a life-interest in a larger
sum, the principal to be afterwards divided amongst her children
if she had any.&nbsp; The remainder of his letter ran as
hereunder:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have learnt that there are some
derelictions of duty which cannot be blotted out by tardy
accomplishment.&nbsp; Our evil actions do not remain isolated in
the past, waiting only to be reversed: like locomotive plants
they spread and re-root, till to destroy the original stem has no
material effect in killing them.&nbsp; I made a mistake in
searching you out; I admit it; whatever the remedy may be in such
cases it is not marriage, and the best thing for you and me is
that you do not see me more.&nbsp; You had better not seek me,
for you will not be likely to find me: you are well provided for,
and we may do ourselves more harm than good by meeting again.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;F. M.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Millborne, in short, disappeared from that day forward.&nbsp;
But a searching inquiry would have revealed that, soon after the
Millbornes went to Ivell, an Englishman, who did not give the
name of Millborne, took up his residence in Brussels; a man who
might have been recognized by Mrs. Millborne if she had met
him.&nbsp; One afternoon in the ensuing summer, when this
gentleman was looking over the English papers, he saw the
announcement of Miss Frances Frankland&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp;
She had become the Reverend Mrs. Cope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; said the gentleman.</p>
<p>But his momentary satisfaction was far from being
happiness.&nbsp; As he formerly had been weighted with a bad
conscience, so now was he burdened with the heavy thought which
oppressed Antigone, that by honourable observance of a rite he
had obtained for himself the reward of dishonourable
laxity.&nbsp; Occasionally he had to be helped to his lodgings by
his servant from the <i>Cercle</i> he frequented, through having
imbibed a little too much liquor to be able to take care of
himself.&nbsp; But he was harmless, and even when he had been
drinking said little.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 1891.</p>
<h2>A TRAGEDY OF TWO AMBITIONS</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>The shouts of the village-boys came in at the window,
accompanied by broken laughter from loungers at the inn-door; but
the brothers Halborough worked on.</p>
<p>They were sitting in a bedroom of the
master-millwright&rsquo;s house, engaged in the untutored reading
of Greek and Latin.&nbsp; It was no tale of Homeric blows and
knocks, Argonautic voyaging, or Theban family woe that inflamed
their imaginations and spurred them onward.&nbsp; They were
plodding away at the Greek Testament, immersed in a chapter of
the idiomatic and difficult Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
<p>The Dog-day sun in its decline reached the low ceiling with
slanting sides, and the shadows of the great goat&rsquo;s-willow
swayed and interchanged upon the walls like a spectral army
manoeuvring.&nbsp; The open casement which admitted the remoter
sounds now brought the voice of some one close at hand.&nbsp; It
was their sister, a pretty girl of fourteen, who stood in the
court below.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can see the tops of your heads!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the use of staying up there?&nbsp; I like you not to go out with
the street-boys; but do come and play with me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They treated her as an inadequate interlocutor, and put her
off with some slight word.&nbsp; She went away
disappointed.&nbsp; Presently there was a dull noise of heavy
footsteps at the side of the house, and one of the brothers sat
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;I fancy I hear him coming,&rsquo; he murmured,
his eyes on the window.</p>
<p>A man in the light drab clothes of an old-fashioned country
tradesman approached from round the corner, reeling as he
came.&nbsp; The elder son flushed with anger, rose from his
books, and descended the stairs.&nbsp; The younger sat on, till,
after the lapse of a few minutes, his brother re-entered the
room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did Rosa see him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor anybody?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you done with him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s in the straw-shed.&nbsp; I got him in with
some trouble, and he has fallen asleep.&nbsp; I thought this
would be the explanation of his absence!&nbsp; No stones dressed
for Miller Kench, the great wheel of the saw-mills waiting for
new float-boards, even the poor folk not able to get their
waggons wheeled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What <i>is</i> the use of poring over this!&rsquo; said
the younger, shutting up Donnegan&rsquo;s <i>Lexicon</i> with a
slap.&nbsp; &lsquo;O if we had only been able to keep
mother&rsquo;s nine hundred pounds, what we could have
done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How well she had estimated the sum necessary!&nbsp;
Four hundred and fifty each, she thought.&nbsp; And I have no
doubt that we could have done it on that, with care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This loss of the nine hundred pounds was the sharp thorn of
their crown.&nbsp; It was a sum which their mother had amassed
with great exertion and self-denial, by adding to a chance legacy
such other small amounts as she could lay hands on from time to
time; and she had intended with the hoard to indulge the dear
wish of her heart&mdash;that of sending her sons, Joshua and
Cornelius, to one of the Universities, having been informed that
from four hundred to four hundred and fifty each might carry them
through their terms with such great economy as she knew she could
trust them to practise.&nbsp; But she had died a year or two
before this time, worn out by too keen a strain towards these
ends; and the money, coming unreservedly into the hands of their
father, had been nearly dissipated.&nbsp; With its exhaustion
went all opportunity and hope of a university degree for the
sons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It drives me mad when I think of it,&rsquo; said
Joshua, the elder.&nbsp; &lsquo;And here we work and work in our
own bungling way, and the utmost we can hope for is a term of
years as national schoolmasters, and possible admission to a
Theological college, and ordination as despised
licentiates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The anger of the elder was reflected as simple sadness in the
face of the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;We can preach the Gospel as well
without a hood on our surplices as with one,&rsquo; he said with
feeble consolation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Preach the Gospel&mdash;true,&rsquo; said Joshua with a
slight pursing of mouth.&nbsp; &lsquo;But we can&rsquo;t
rise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us make the best of it, and grind on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The other was silent, and they drearily bent over their books
again.</p>
<p>The cause of all this gloom, the millwright Halborough, now
snoring in the shed, had been a thriving master-machinist,
notwithstanding his free and careless disposition, till a taste
for a more than adequate quantity of strong liquor took hold of
him; since when his habits had interfered with his business
sadly.&nbsp; Already millers went elsewhere for their gear, and
only one set of hands was now kept going, though there were
formerly two.&nbsp; Already he found a difficulty in meeting his
men at the week&rsquo;s end, and though they had been reduced in
number there was barely enough work to do for those who
remained.</p>
<p>The sun dropped lower and vanished, the shouts of the village
children ceased to resound, darkness cloaked the students&rsquo;
bedroom, and all the scene outwardly breathed peace.&nbsp; None
knew of the fevered youthful ambitions that throbbed in two
breasts within the quiet creeper-covered walls of the
millwright&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In a few months the brothers left the village of their birth
to enter themselves as students in a training college for
schoolmasters; first having placed their young sister Rosa under
as efficient a tuition at a fashionable watering-place as the
means at their disposal could command.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>A man in semi-clerical dress was walking along the road which
led from the railway-station into a provincial town.&nbsp; As he
walked he read persistently, only looking up once now and then to
see that he was keeping on the foot track and to avoid other
passengers.&nbsp; At those moments, whoever had known the former
students at the millwright&rsquo;s would have perceived that one
of them, Joshua Halborough, was the peripatetic reader here.</p>
<p>What had been simple force in the youth&rsquo;s face was
energized judgment in the man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His character was
gradually writing itself out in his countenance.&nbsp; That he
was watching his own career with deeper and deeper interest, that
he continually &lsquo;heard his days before him,&rsquo; and cared
to hear little else, might have been hazarded from what was seen
there.&nbsp; His ambitions were, in truth, passionate, yet
controlled; so that the germs of many more plans than ever
blossomed to maturity had place in him; and forward visions were
kept purposely in twilight, to avoid distraction.</p>
<p>Events so far had been encouraging.&nbsp; Shortly after
assuming the mastership of his first school he had obtained an
introduction to the Bishop of a diocese far from his native
county, who had looked upon him as a promising young man and
taken him in hand.&nbsp; He was now in the second year of his
residence at the theological college of the cathedral-town, and
would soon be presented for ordination.</p>
<p>He entered the town, turned into a back street, and then into
a yard, keeping his book before him till he set foot under the
arch of the latter place.&nbsp; Round the arch was written
&lsquo;National School,&rsquo; and the stonework of the jambs was
worn away as nothing but boys and the waves of ocean will wear
it.&nbsp; He was soon amid the sing-song accents of the
scholars.</p>
<p>His brother Cornelius, who was the schoolmaster here, laid
down the pointer with which he was directing attention to the
Capes of Europe, and came forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s his brother Jos!&rsquo; whispered one of
the sixth standard boys.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to be a
pa&rsquo;son, he&rsquo;s now at college.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Corney is going to be one too, when he&rsquo;s saved
enough money,&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p>After greeting his brother, whom he had not seen for several
months, the junior began to explain his system of teaching
geography.</p>
<p>But Halborough the elder took no interest in the
subject.&nbsp; &lsquo;How about your own studies?&rsquo; he
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you get the books I sent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius had received them, and he related what he was
doing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind you work in the morning.&nbsp; What time do you
get up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The younger replied: &lsquo;Half-past five.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Half-past four is not a minute too soon this time of
the year.&nbsp; There is no time like the morning for
construing.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know why, but when I feel even
too dreary to read a novel I can translate&mdash;there is
something mechanical about it I suppose.&nbsp; Now, Cornelius,
you are rather behindhand, and have some heavy reading before you
if you mean to get out of this next Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid I have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must soon sound the Bishop.&nbsp; I am sure you will
get a title without difficulty when he has heard all.&nbsp; The
sub-dean, the principal of my college, says that the best plan
will be for you to come there when his lordship is present at an
examination, and he&rsquo;ll get you a personal interview with
him.&nbsp; Mind you make a good impression upon him.&nbsp; I
found in my case that that was everything and doctrine almost
nothing.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll do for a deacon, Corney, if not for a
priest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The younger remained thoughtful.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you heard
from Rosa lately?&rsquo; he asked; &lsquo;I had a letter this
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; The little minx writes rather too
often.&nbsp; She is homesick&mdash;though Brussels must be an
attractive place enough.&nbsp; But she must make the most of her
time over there.&nbsp; I thought a year would be enough for her,
after that high-class school at Sandbourne, but I have decided to
give her two, and make a good job of it, expensive as the
establishment is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their two rather harsh faces had softened directly they began
to speak of their sister, whom they loved more ambitiously than
they loved themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where is the money to come from, Joshua?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have already got it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He looked round,
and finding that some boys were near withdrew a few steps.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have borrowed it at five per cent. from the farmer who
used to occupy the farm next our field.&nbsp; You remember
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But about paying him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall pay him by degrees out of my stipend.&nbsp; No,
Cornelius, it was no use to do the thing by halves.&nbsp; She
promises to be a most attractive, not to say beautiful,
girl.&nbsp; I have seen that for years; and if her face is not
her fortune, her face and her brains together will be, if I
observe and contrive aright.&nbsp; That she should be, every inch
of her, an accomplished and refined woman, was indispensable for
the fulfilment of her destiny, and for moving onwards and upwards
with us; and she&rsquo;ll do it, you will see.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
half starve myself rather than take her away from that school
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They looked round the school they were in.&nbsp; To Cornelius
it was natural and familiar enough, but to Joshua, with his
limited human sympathies, who had just dropped in from a superior
sort of place, the sight jarred unpleasantly, as being that of
something he had left behind.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall be glad when
you are out of this,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and in your pulpit,
and well through your first sermon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may as well say inducted into my fat living, while
you are about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well&mdash;don&rsquo;t think lightly of the
Church.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a fine work for any man of energy in
the Church, as you&rsquo;ll find,&rsquo; he said fervidly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Torrents of infidelity to be stemmed, new views of old
subjects to be expounded, truths in spirit to be substituted for
truths in the letter . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; He lapsed into reverie
with the vision of his career, persuading himself that it was
ardour for Christianity which spurred him on, and not pride of
place.&nbsp; He had shouldered a body of doctrine, and was
prepared to defend it tooth and nail, solely for the honour and
glory that warriors win.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the Church is elastic, and stretches to the shape of
the time, she&rsquo;ll last, I suppose,&rsquo; said
Cornelius.&nbsp; &lsquo;If not&mdash;.&nbsp; Only think, I bought
a copy of Paley&rsquo;s <i>Evidences</i>, best edition, broad
margins, excellent preservation, at a bookstall the other day
for&mdash;ninepence; and I thought that at this rate Christianity
must be in rather a bad way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said the other almost, angrily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It only shows that such defences are no longer
necessary.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s eyes can see the truth without
extraneous assistance.&nbsp; Besides, we are in for Christianity,
and must stick to her whether or no.&nbsp; I am just now going
right through Pusey&rsquo;s <i>Library of the
Fathers</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be a bishop, Joshua, before you have
done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the other bitterly, shaking his
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I might have been&mdash;I might have
been!&nbsp; But where is my D.D. or LL.D.; and how be a bishop
without that kind of appendage?&nbsp; Archbishop Tillotson was
the son of a Sowerby clothier, but he was sent to Clare
College.&nbsp; To hail Oxford or Cambridge as <i>alma mater</i>
is not for me&mdash;for us!&nbsp; My God! when I think of what we
should have been&mdash;what fair promise has been blighted by
that cursed, worthless&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush! . . . But I feel it, too, as much as
you.&nbsp; I have seen it more forcibly lately.&nbsp; You would
have obtained your degree long before this time&mdash;possibly
fellowship&mdash;and I should have been on my way to
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it,&rsquo; said the other.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We must do the best we can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They looked out of the window sadly, through the dusty panes,
so high up that only the sky was visible.&nbsp; By degrees the
haunting trouble loomed again, and Cornelius broke the silence
with a whisper: &lsquo;He has called on me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The living pulses died on Joshua&rsquo;s face, which grew arid
as a clinker.&nbsp; &lsquo;When was that?&rsquo; he asked
quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Last week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did he get here&mdash;so many miles?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Came by railway.&nbsp; He came to ask for
money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He says he will call on you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joshua replied resignedly.&nbsp; The theme of their
conversation spoilt his buoyancy for that afternoon.&nbsp; He
returned in the evening, Cornelius accompanying him to the
station; but he did not read in the train which took him back to
the Fountall Theological College, as he had done on the way
out.&nbsp; That ineradicable trouble still remained as a squalid
spot in the expanse of his life.&nbsp; He sat with the other
students in the cathedral choir next day; and the recollection of
the trouble obscured the purple splendour thrown by the panes
upon the floor.</p>
<p>It was afternoon.&nbsp; All was as still in the Close as a
cathedral-green can be between the Sunday services, and the
incessant cawing of the rooks was the only sound.&nbsp; Joshua
Halborough had finished his ascetic lunch, and had gone into the
library, where he stood for a few moments looking out of the
large window facing the green.&nbsp; He saw walking slowly across
it a man in a fustian coat and a battered white hat with a
much-ruffled nap, having upon his arm a tall gipsy-woman wearing
long brass earrings.&nbsp; The man was staring quizzically at the
west front of the cathedral, and Halborough recognized in him the
form and features of his father.&nbsp; Who the woman was he knew
not.&nbsp; Almost as soon as Joshua became conscious of these
things, the sub-dean, who was also the principal of the college,
and of whom the young man stood in more awe than of the Bishop
himself, emerged from the gate and entered a path across the
Close.&nbsp; The pair met the dignitary, and to Joshua&rsquo;s
horror his father turned and addressed the sub-dean.</p>
<p>What passed between them he could not tell.&nbsp; But as he
stood in a cold sweat he saw his father place his hand familiarly
on the sub-dean&rsquo;s shoulder; the shrinking response of the
latter, and his quick withdrawal, told his feeling.&nbsp; The
woman seemed to say nothing, but when the sub-dean had passed by
they came on towards the college gate.</p>
<p>Halborough flew along the corridor and out at a side door, so
as to intercept them before they could reach the front entrance,
for which they were making.&nbsp; He caught them behind a clump
of laurel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jerry, here&rsquo;s the very chap!&nbsp; Well,
you&rsquo;re a fine fellow, Jos, never to send your father as
much as a twist o&rsquo; baccy on such an occasion, and to leave
him to travel all these miles to find ye out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;First, who is this?&rsquo; said Joshua Halborough with
pale dignity, waving his hand towards the buxom woman with the
great earrings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dammy, the mis&rsquo;ess!&nbsp; Your step-mother!&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;d married?&nbsp; She helped me home
from market one night, and we came to terms, and struck the
bargain.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t we, Selinar?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oi, by the great Lord an&rsquo; we did!&rsquo; simpered
the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what sort of a place is this you are living
in?&rsquo; asked the millwright.&nbsp; &lsquo;A kind of
house-of-correction, apparently?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joshua listened abstractedly, his features set to
resignation.&nbsp; Sick at heart he was going to ask them if they
were in want of any necessary, any meal, when his father cut him
short by saying, &lsquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve called to ask ye to come
round and take pot-luck with us at the Cock-and-Bottle, where
we&rsquo;ve put up for the day, on our way to see
mis&rsquo;ess&rsquo;s friends at Binegar Fair, where
they&rsquo;ll be lying under canvas for a night or two.&nbsp; As
for the victuals at the Cock I can&rsquo;t testify to &rsquo;em
at all; but for the drink, they&rsquo;ve the rarest drop of Old
Tom that I&rsquo;ve tasted for many a year.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks; but I am a teetotaller; and I have
lunched,&rsquo; said Joshua, who could fully believe his
father&rsquo;s testimony to the gin, from the odour of his
breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see we have to observe regular habits
here; and I couldn&rsquo;t be seen at the Cock-and-Bottle just
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O dammy, then don&rsquo;t come, your reverence.&nbsp;
Perhaps you won&rsquo;t mind standing treat for those who can be
seen there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a penny,&rsquo; said the younger firmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve had enough already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you for nothing.&nbsp; By the bye, who was that
spindle-legged, shoe-buckled parson feller we met by now?&nbsp;
He seemed to think we should poison him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joshua remarked coldly that it was the principal of his
college, guardedly inquiring, &lsquo;Did you tell him whom you
were come to see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>His father did not reply.&nbsp; He and his strapping gipsy
wife&mdash;if she were his wife&mdash;stayed no longer, and
disappeared in the direction of the High Street.&nbsp; Joshua
Halborough went back to the library.&nbsp; Determined as was his
nature, he wept hot tears upon the books, and was immeasurably
more wretched that afternoon than the unwelcome millwright.&nbsp;
In the evening he sat down and wrote a letter to his brother, in
which, after stating what had happened, and expatiating upon this
new disgrace in the gipsy wife, he propounded a plan for raising
money sufficient to induce the couple to emigrate to
Canada.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is our only chance,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The case as it stands is maddening.&nbsp; For a successful
painter, sculptor, musician, author, who takes society by storm,
it is no drawback, it is sometimes even a romantic
recommendation, to hail from outcasts and profligates.&nbsp; But
for a clergyman of the Church of England!&nbsp; Cornelius, it is
fatal!&nbsp; To succeed in the Church, people must believe in
you, first of all, as a gentleman, secondly as a man of means,
thirdly as a scholar, fourthly as a preacher, fifthly, perhaps,
as a Christian,&mdash;but always first as a gentleman, with all
their heart and soul and strength.&nbsp; I would have faced the
fact of being a small machinist&rsquo;s son, and have taken my
chance, if he&rsquo;d been in any sense respectable and
decent.&nbsp; The essence of Christianity is humility, and by the
help of God I would have brazened it out.&nbsp; But this terrible
vagabondage and disreputable connection!&nbsp; If he does not
accept my terms and leave the country, it will extinguish us and
kill me.&nbsp; For how can we live, and relinquish our high aim,
and bring down our dear sister Rosa to the level of a
gipsy&rsquo;s step-daughter?&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>There was excitement in the parish of Narrobourne one
day.&nbsp; The congregation had just come out from morning
service, and the whole conversation was of the new curate, Mr.
Halborough, who had officiated for the first time, in the absence
of the rector.</p>
<p>Never before had the feeling of the villagers approached a
level which could be called excitement on such a matter as
this.&nbsp; The droning which had been the rule in that quiet old
place for a century seemed ended at last.&nbsp; They repeated the
text to each other as a refrain: &lsquo;O Lord, be thou my
helper!&rsquo;&nbsp; Not within living memory till to-day had the
subject of the sermon formed the topic of conversation from the
church door to church-yard gate, to the exclusion of personal
remarks on those who had been present, and on the week&rsquo;s
news in general.</p>
<p>The thrilling periods of the preacher hung about their minds
all that day.&nbsp; The parish being steeped in indifferentism,
it happened that when the youths and maidens, middle-aged and old
people, who had attended church that morning, recurred as by a
fascination to what Halborough had said, they did so more or less
indirectly, and even with the subterfuge of a light laugh that
was not real, so great was their shyness under the novelty of
their sensations.</p>
<p>What was more curious than that these unconventional villagers
should have been excited by a preacher of a new school after
forty years of familiarity with the old hand who had had charge
of their souls, was the effect of Halborough&rsquo;s address upon
the occupants of the manor-house pew, including the owner of the
estate.&nbsp; These thought they knew how to discount the mere
sensational sermon, how to minimize flash oratory to its bare
proportions; but they had yielded like the rest of the assembly
to the charm of the newcomer.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellmer, the landowner, was a young widower, whose mother,
still in the prime of life, had returned to her old position in
the family mansion since the death of her son&rsquo;s wife in the
year after her marriage, at the birth of a fragile little
girl.&nbsp; From the date of his loss to the present time,
Fellmer had led an inactive existence in the seclusion of the
parish; a lack of motive seemed to leave him listless.&nbsp; He
had gladly reinstated his mother in the gloomy house, and his
main occupation now lay in stewarding his estate, which was not
large.&nbsp; Mrs. Fellmer, who had sat beside him under
Halborough this morning, was a cheerful, straightforward woman,
who did her marketing and her alms-giving in person, was fond of
old-fashioned flowers, and walked about the village on very wet
days visiting the parishioners.&nbsp; These, the only two great
ones of Narrobourne, were impressed by Joshua&rsquo;s eloquence
as much as the cottagers.</p>
<p>Halborough had been briefly introduced to them on his arrival
some days before, and, their interest being kindled, they waited
a few moments till he came out of the vestry, to walk down the
churchyard-path with him.&nbsp; Mrs. Fellmer spoke warmly of the
sermon, of the good fortune of the parish in his advent, and
hoped he had found comfortable quarters.</p>
<p>Halborough, faintly flushing, said that he had obtained very
fair lodgings in the roomy house of a farmer, whom he named.</p>
<p>She feared he would find it very lonely, especially in the
evenings, and hoped they would see a good deal of him.&nbsp; When
would he dine with them?&nbsp; Could he not come that
day&mdash;it must be so dull for him the first Sunday evening in
country lodgings?</p>
<p>Halborough replied that it would give him much pleasure, but
that he feared he must decline.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not altogether
alone,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;My sister, who has just
returned from Brussels, and who felt, as you do, that I should be
rather dismal by myself, has accompanied me hither to stay a few
days till she has put my rooms in order and set me going.&nbsp;
She was too fatigued to come to church, and is waiting for me now
at the farm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, but bring your sister&mdash;that will be still
better!&nbsp; I shall be delighted to know her.&nbsp; How I wish
I had been aware!&nbsp; Do tell her, please, that we had no idea
of her presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Halborough assured Mrs. Fellmer that he would certainly bear
the message; but as to her coming he was not so sure.&nbsp; The
real truth was, however, that the matter would be decided by him,
Rosa having an almost filial respect for his wishes.&nbsp; But he
was uncertain as to the state of her wardrobe, and had determined
that she should not enter the manor-house at a disadvantage that
evening, when there would probably be plenty of opportunities in
the future of her doing so becomingly.</p>
<p>He walked to the farm in long strides.&nbsp; This, then, was
the outcome of his first morning&rsquo;s work as curate
here.&nbsp; Things had gone fairly well with him.&nbsp; He had
been ordained; he was in a comfortable parish, where he would
exercise almost sole supervision, the rector being infirm.&nbsp;
He had made a deep impression at starting, and the absence of a
hood seemed to have done him no harm.&nbsp; Moreover, by
considerable persuasion and payment, his father and the dark
woman had been shipped off to Canada, where they were not likely
to interfere greatly with his interests.</p>
<p>Rosa came out to meet him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! you should have
gone to church like a good girl,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;I wished I had afterwards.&nbsp; But I do so
hate church as a rule that even your preaching was underestimated
in my mind.&nbsp; It was too bad of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl who spoke thus playfully was fair, tall, and
sylph-like, in a muslin dress, and with just the coquettish
<i>d&eacute;sinvolture</i> which an English girl brings home from
abroad, and loses again after a few months of native life.&nbsp;
Joshua was the reverse of playful; the world was too important a
concern for him to indulge in light moods.&nbsp; He told her in
decided, practical phraseology of the invitation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Rosa, we must go&mdash;that&rsquo;s
settled&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve a dress that can be made fit to
wear all on the hop like this.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t, of course,
think of bringing an evening dress to such an out-of-the-way
place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Rosa had come from the wrong city to be caught napping in
those matters.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I did,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;One never knows what may turn up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done!&nbsp; Then off we go at seven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The evening drew on, and at dusk they started on foot, Rosa
pulling up the edge of her skirt under her cloak out of the way
of the dews, so that it formed a great wind-bag all round her,
and carrying her satin shoes under her arm.&nbsp; Joshua would
not let her wait till she got indoors before changing them, as
she proposed, but insisted on her performing that operation under
a tree, so that they might enter as if they had not walked.&nbsp;
He was nervously formal about such trifles, while Rosa took the
whole proceeding&mdash;walk, dressing, dinner, and all&mdash;as a
pastime.&nbsp; To Joshua it was a serious step in life.</p>
<p>A more unexpected kind of person for a curate&rsquo;s sister
was never presented at a dinner.&nbsp; The surprise of Mrs.
Fellmer was unconcealed.&nbsp; She had looked forward to a
Dorcas, or Martha, or Rhoda at the outside, and a shade of
misgiving crossed her face.&nbsp; It was possible that, had the
young lady accompanied her brother to church, there would have
been no dining at Narrobourne House that day.</p>
<p>Not so with the young widower, her son.&nbsp; He resembled a
sleeper who had awaked in a summer noon expecting to find it only
dawn.&nbsp; He could scarcely help stretching his arms and
yawning in their faces, so strong was his sense of being suddenly
aroused to an unforeseen thing.&nbsp; When they had sat down to
table he at first talked to Rosa somewhat with the air of a ruler
in the land; but the woman lurking in the acquaintance soon
brought him to his level, and the girl from Brussels saw him
looking at her mouth, her hands, her contour, as if he could not
quite comprehend how they got created: then he dropped into the
more satisfactory stage which discerns no particulars.</p>
<p>He talked but little; she said much.&nbsp; The homeliness of
the Fellmers, to her view, though they were regarded with such
awe down here, quite disembarrassed her.&nbsp; The squire had
become so unpractised, had dropped so far into the shade during
the last year or so of his life, that he had almost forgotten
what the world contained till this evening reminded him.&nbsp;
His mother, after her first moments of doubt, appeared to think
that he must be left to his own guidance, and gave her attention
to Joshua.</p>
<p>With all his foresight and doggedness of aim, the result of
that dinner exceeded Halborough&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp; In
weaving his ambitions he had viewed his sister Rosa as a slight,
bright thing to be helped into notice by his abilities; but it
now began to dawn upon him that the physical gifts of nature to
her might do more for them both than nature&rsquo;s intellectual
gifts to himself.&nbsp; While he was patiently boring the tunnel
Rosa seemed about to fly over the mountain.</p>
<p>He wrote the next day to his brother, now occupying his own
old rooms in the theological college, telling him exultingly of
the unanticipated <i>d&eacute;but</i> of Rosa at the
manor-house.&nbsp; The next post brought him a reply of
congratulation, dashed with the counteracting intelligence that
his father did not like Canada&mdash;that his wife had deserted
him, which made him feel so dreary that he thought of returning
home.</p>
<p>In his recent satisfaction at his own successes Joshua
Halborough had well-nigh forgotten his chronic
trouble&mdash;latterly screened by distance.&nbsp; But it now
returned upon him; he saw more in this brief announcement than
his brother seemed to see.&nbsp; It was the cloud no bigger than
a man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>The following December, a day or two before Christmas, Mrs.
Fellmer and her son were walking up and down the broad gravel
path which bordered the east front of the house.&nbsp; Till
within the last half-hour the morning had been a drizzling one,
and they had just emerged for a short turn before luncheon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, dear mother,&rsquo; the son was saying,
&lsquo;it is the peculiarity of my position which makes her
appear to me in such a desirable light.&nbsp; When you consider
how I have been crippled at starting, how my life has been
maimed; that I feel anything like publicity distasteful, that I
have ye no political ambition, and that my chief aim and hope lie
in the education of the little thing Annie has left me, you must
see how desirable a wife like Miss Halborough would be, to
prevent my becoming a mere vegetable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you adore her, I suppose you must have her!&rsquo;
replied his mother with dry indirectness.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
you&rsquo;ll find that she will not be content to live on here as
you do, giving her whole mind to a young child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just where we differ.&nbsp; Her very
disqualification, that of being a nobody, as you call it, is her
recommendation in my eyes.&nbsp; Her lack of influential
connections limits her ambition.&nbsp; From what I know of her, a
life in this place is all that she would wish for.&nbsp; She
would never care to go outside the park-gates if it were
necessary to stay within.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Being in love with her, Albert, and meaning to marry
her, you invent your practical reasons to make the case
respectable.&nbsp; Well, do as you will; I have no authority over
you, so why should you consult me?&nbsp; You mean to propose on
this very occasion, no doubt.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you,
now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means.&nbsp; I am merely revolving the idea in my
mind.&nbsp; If on further acquaintance she turns out to be as
good as she has hitherto seemed&mdash;well, I shall see.&nbsp;
Admit, now, that you like her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I readily admit it.&nbsp; She is very captivating at
first sight.&nbsp; But as a stepmother to your child!&nbsp; You
seem mighty anxious, Albert, to get rid of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; And I am not so reckless as you
think.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t make up my mind in a hurry.&nbsp; But
the thought having occurred to me, I mention it to you at once,
mother.&nbsp; If you dislike it, say so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp; I will try to make
the best of it if you are determined.&nbsp; When does she
come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All this time there were great preparations in train at the
curate&rsquo;s, who was now a householder.&nbsp; Rosa, whose two
or three weeks&rsquo; stay on two occasions earlier in the year
had so affected the squire, was coming again, and at the same
time her younger brother Cornelius, to make up a family
party.&nbsp; Rosa, who journeyed from the Midlands, could not
arrive till late in the evening, but Cornelius was to get there
in the afternoon, Joshua going out to meet him in his walk across
the fields from the railway.</p>
<p>Everything being ready in Joshua&rsquo;s modest abode he
started on his way, his heart buoyant and thankful, if ever it
was in his life.&nbsp; He was of such good report himself that
his brother&rsquo;s path into holy orders promised to be
unexpectedly easy; and he longed to compare experiences with him,
even though there was on hand a more exciting matter still.&nbsp;
From his youth he had held that, in old-fashioned country places,
the Church conferred social prestige up to a certain point at a
cheaper price than any other profession or pursuit; and events
seemed to be proving him right.</p>
<p>He had walked about half an hour when he saw Cornelius coming
along the path; and in a few minutes the two brothers met.&nbsp;
The experiences of Cornelius had been less immediately
interesting than those of Joshua, but his personal position was
satisfactory, and there was nothing to account for the singularly
subdued manner that he exhibited, which at first Joshua set down
to the fatigue of over-study; and he proceeded to the subject of
Rosa&rsquo;s arrival in the evening, and the probable
consequences of this her third visit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Before next
Easter she&rsquo;ll be his wife, my boy,&rsquo; said Joshua with
grave exultation.</p>
<p>Cornelius shook his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;She comes too
late!&rsquo; he returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here.&rsquo;&nbsp; He produced the Fountall paper,
and placed his finger on a paragraph, which Joshua read.&nbsp; It
appeared under the report of Petty Sessions, and was a
commonplace case of disorderly conduct, in which a man was sent
to prison for seven days for breaking windows in that town.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Joshua.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It happened during an evening that I was in the street;
and the offender is our father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not&mdash;how&mdash;I sent him more money on his
promising to stay in Canada?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is home, safe enough.&rsquo;&nbsp; Cornelius in the
same gloomy tone gave the remainder of his information.&nbsp; He
had witnessed the scene, unobserved of his father, and had heard
him say that he was on his way to see his daughter, who was going
to marry a rich gentleman.&nbsp; The only good fortune attending
the untoward incident was that the millwright&rsquo;s name had
been printed as Joshua Alborough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beaten!&nbsp; We are to be beaten on the eve of our
expected victory!&rsquo; said the elder brother.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
did he guess that Rosa was likely to marry?&nbsp; Good Heaven
Cornelius, you seem doomed to bring bad news always, do you
not!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do,&rsquo; said Cornelius.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor
Rosa!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was almost in tears, so great was their heart-sickness and
shame, that the brothers walked the remainder of the way to
Joshua&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; In the evening they set out to
meet Rosa, bringing her to the village in a fly; and when she had
come into the house, and was sitting down with them, they almost
forgot their secret anxiety in contemplating her, who knew
nothing about it.</p>
<p>Next day the Fellmers came, and the two or three days after
that were a lively time.&nbsp; That the squire was yielding to
his impulses&mdash;making up his mind&mdash;there could be no
doubt.&nbsp; On Sunday Cornelius read the lessons, and Joshua
preached.&nbsp; Mrs. Fellmer was quite maternal towards Rosa, and
it appeared that she had decided to welcome the inevitable with a
good grace.&nbsp; The pretty girl was to spend yet another
afternoon with the elder lady, superintending some parish treat
at the house in observance of Christmas, and afterwards to stay
on to dinner, her brothers to fetch her in the evening.&nbsp;
They were also invited to dine, but they could not accept owing
to an engagement.</p>
<p>The engagement was of a sombre sort.&nbsp; They were going to
meet their father, who would that day be released from Fountall
Gaol, and try to persuade him to keep away from
Narrobourne.&nbsp; Every exertion was to be made to get him back
to Canada, to his old home in the Midlands&mdash;anywhere, so
that he would not impinge disastrously upon their courses, and
blast their sister&rsquo;s prospects of the auspicious marriage
which was just then hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>As soon as Rosa had been fetched away by her friends at the
manor-house her brothers started on their expedition, without
waiting for dinner or tea.&nbsp; Cornelius, to whom the
millwright always addressed his letters when he wrote any, drew
from his pocket and re-read as he walked the curt note which had
led to this journey being undertaken; it was despatched by their
father the night before, immediately upon his liberation, and
stated that he was setting out for Narrobourne at the moment of
writing; that having no money he would be obliged to walk all the
way; that he calculated on passing through the intervening town
of Ivell about six on the following day, where he should sup at
the Castle Inn, and where he hoped they would meet him with a
carriage-and-pair, or some other such conveyance, that he might
not disgrace them by arriving like a tramp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That sounds as if he gave a thought to our
position,&rsquo; said Cornelius.</p>
<p>Joshua knew the satire that lurked in the paternal words, and
said nothing.&nbsp; Silence prevailed during the greater part of
their journey.&nbsp; The lamps were lighted in Ivell when they
entered the streets, and Cornelius, who was quite unknown in this
neighbourhood, and who, moreover, was not in clerical attire,
decided that he should be the one to call at the Castle
Inn.&nbsp; Here, in answer to his inquiry under the darkness of
the archway, they told him that such a man as he had described
left the house about a quarter of an hour earlier, after making a
meal in the kitchen-settle.&nbsp; He was rather the worse for
liquor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Joshua, when Cornelius joined him
outside with this intelligence, &lsquo;we must have met and
passed him!&nbsp; And now that I think of it, we did meet some
one who was unsteady in his gait, under the trees on the other
side of Hendford Hill, where it was too dark to see
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They rapidly retraced their steps; but for a long stretch of
the way home could discern nobody.&nbsp; When, however, they had
gone about three-quarters of the distance, they became conscious
of an irregular footfall in front of them, and could see a
whitish figure in the gloom.&nbsp; They followed dubiously.&nbsp;
The figure met another wayfarer&mdash;the single one that had
been encountered upon this lonely road&mdash;and they distinctly
heard him ask the way to Narrobourne.&nbsp; The stranger
replied&mdash;what was quite true&mdash;that the nearest way was
by turning in at the stile by the next bridge, and following the
footpath which branched thence across the meadows.</p>
<p>When the brothers reached the stile they also entered the
path, but did not overtake the subject of their worry till they
had crossed two or three meads, and the lights from Narrobourne
manor-house were visible before them through the trees.&nbsp;
Their father was no longer walking; he was seated against the wet
bank of an adjoining hedge.&nbsp; Observing their forms he
shouted, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to Narrobourne; who may you
be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went up to him, and revealed themselves, reminding him of
the plan which he had himself proposed in his note, that they
should meet him at Ivell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jerry, I&rsquo;d forgot it!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, what do you want me to do?&rsquo;&nbsp; His tone was
distinctly quarrelsome.</p>
<p>A long conversation followed, which became embittered at the
first hint from them that he should not come to the
village.&nbsp; The millwright drew a quart bottle from his
pocket, and challenged them to drink if they meant friendly and
called themselves men.&nbsp; Neither of the two had touched
alcohol for years, but for once they thought it best to accept,
so as not to needlessly provoke him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s in it?&rsquo; said Joshua.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A drop of weak gin-and-water.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t hurt
ye.&nbsp; Drin&rsquo; from the bottle.&rsquo;&nbsp; Joshua did
so, and his father pushed up the bottom of the vessel so as to
make him swallow a good deal in spite of himself.&nbsp; It went
down into his stomach like molten lead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha, that&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; said old
Halborough.&nbsp; &lsquo;But &rsquo;twas raw spirit&mdash;ha,
ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you take me in so!&rsquo; said Joshua,
losing his self-command, try as he would to keep calm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you took me in, my lad, in banishing me to that
cursed country under pretence that it was for my good.&nbsp; You
were a pair of hypocrites to say so.&nbsp; It was done to get rid
of me&mdash;no more nor less.&nbsp; But, by Jerry, I&rsquo;m a
match for ye now!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll spoil your souls for
preaching.&nbsp; My daughter is going to be married to the squire
here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard the news&mdash;I saw it in a
paper!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is premature&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it is true; and I&rsquo;m her father, and I
shall give her away, or there&rsquo;ll be a hell of a row, I can
assure ye!&nbsp; Is that where the gennleman lives?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joshua Halborough writhed in impotent despair.&nbsp; Fellmer
had not yet positively declared himself, his mother was hardly
won round; a scene with their father in the parish would demolish
as fair a palace of hopes as was ever builded.&nbsp; The
millwright rose.&nbsp; &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s where the squire
lives I&rsquo;m going to call.&nbsp; Just arrived from Canady
with her fortune&mdash;ha, ha!&nbsp; I wish no harm to the
gennleman, and the gennleman will wish no harm to me.&nbsp; But I
like to take my place in the family, and stand upon my rights,
and lower people&rsquo;s pride!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve succeeded already!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
that woman you took with you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Woman!&nbsp; She was my wife as lawful as the
Constitution&mdash;a sight more lawful than your mother was till
some time after you were born!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joshua had for many years before heard whispers that his
father had cajoled his mother in their early acquaintance, and
had made somewhat tardy amends; but never from his father&rsquo;s
lips till now.&nbsp; It was the last stroke, and he could not
bear it.&nbsp; He sank back against the hedge.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
over!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He ruins us all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The millwright moved on, waving his stick triumphantly, and
the two brothers stood still.&nbsp; They could see his drab
figure stalking along the path, and over his head the lights from
the conservatory of Narrobourne House, inside which Albert
Fellmer might possibly be sitting with Rosa at that moment,
holding her hand, and asking her to share his home with him.</p>
<p>The staggering whitey-brown form, advancing to put a blot on
all this, had been diminishing in the shade; and now suddenly
disappeared beside a weir.&nbsp; There was the noise of a flounce
in the water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has fallen in!&rsquo; said Cornelius, starting
forward to run for the place at which his father had
vanished.</p>
<p>Joshua, awaking from the stupefied reverie into which he had
sunk, rushed to the other&rsquo;s side before he had taken ten
steps.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop, stop, what are you thinking of?&rsquo;
he whispered hoarsely, grasping Cornelius&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pulling him out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes&mdash;so am I.&nbsp; But&mdash;wait a
moment&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Joshua!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her life and happiness, you
know&mdash;Cornelius&mdash;and your reputation and mine&mdash;and
our chance of rising together, all three&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He clutched his brother&rsquo;s arm to the bone; and as they
stood breathless the splashing and floundering in the weir
continued; over it they saw the hopeful lights from the
manor-house conservatory winking through the trees as their bare
branches waved to and fro.</p>
<p>The floundering and splashing grew weaker, and they could hear
gurgling words: &lsquo;Help&mdash;I&rsquo;m drownded!&nbsp;
Rosie&mdash;Rosie!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go&mdash;we must save him.&nbsp; O
Joshua!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes! we must!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still they did not move, but waited, holding each other, each
thinking the same thought.&nbsp; Weights of lead seemed to be
affixed to their feet, which would no longer obey their
wills.&nbsp; The mead became silent.&nbsp; Over it they fancied
they could see figures moving in the conservatory.&nbsp; The air
up there seemed to emit gentle kisses.</p>
<p>Cornelius started forward at last, and Joshua almost
simultaneously.&nbsp; Two or three minutes brought them to the
brink of the stream.&nbsp; At first they could see nothing in the
water, though it was not so deep nor the night so dark but that
their father&rsquo;s light kerseymere coat would have been
visible if he had lain at the bottom.&nbsp; Joshua looked this
way and that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has drifted into the culvert,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Below the foot-bridge of the weir the stream suddenly narrowed
to half its width, to pass under a barrel arch or culvert
constructed for waggons to cross into the middle of the mead in
haymaking time.&nbsp; It being at present the season of high
water the arch was full to the crown, against which the ripples
clucked every now and then.&nbsp; At this point he had just
caught sight of a pale object slipping under.&nbsp; In a moment
it was gone.</p>
<p>They went to the lower end, but nothing emerged.&nbsp; For a
long time they tried at both ends to effect some communication
with the interior, but to no purpose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We ought to have come sooner!&rsquo; said the
conscience-stricken Cornelius, when they were quite exhausted,
and dripping wet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose we ought,&rsquo; replied Joshua
heavily.&nbsp; He perceived his father&rsquo;s walking-stick on
the bank; hastily picking it up he stuck it into the mud among
the sedge.&nbsp; Then they went on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall we&mdash;say anything about this accident?&rsquo;
whispered Cornelius as they approached the door of Joshua&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&nbsp; It can do no good.&nbsp; We
must wait until he is found.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went indoors and changed their clothes; after which they
started for the manor-house, reaching it about ten
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Besides their sister there were only three
guests; an adjoining landowner and his wife, and the infirm old
rector.</p>
<p>Rosa, although she had parted from them so recently, grasped
their hands in an ecstatic, brimming, joyful manner, as if she
had not seen them for years.&nbsp; &lsquo;You look pale,&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>The brothers answered that they had had a long walk, and were
somewhat tired.&nbsp; Everybody in the room seemed charged full
with some sort of interesting knowledge: the squire&rsquo;s
neighbour and his wife looked wisely around; and Fellmer himself
played the part of host with a preoccupied bearing which
approached fervour.&nbsp; They left at eleven, not accepting the
carriage offered, the distance being so short and the roads
dry.&nbsp; The squire came rather farther into the dark with them
than he need have done, and wished Rosa good-night in a
mysterious manner, slightly apart from the rest.</p>
<p>When they were walking along Joshua said, with desperate
attempt at joviality, &lsquo;Rosa, what&rsquo;s going
on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I&mdash;&rsquo; she began between a gasp and a
bound.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind&mdash;if it disturbs you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was so excited that she could not speak connectedly at
first, the practised air which she had brought home with her
having disappeared.&nbsp; Calming herself she added, &lsquo;I am
not disturbed, and nothing has happened.&nbsp; Only he said he
wanted to ask me <i>something</i>, some day; and I said never
mind that now.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t asked yet, and is coining to
speak to you about it.&nbsp; He would have done so to-night, only
I asked him not to be in a hurry.&nbsp; But he will come
to-morrow, I am sure!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>It was summer-time, six months later, and mowers and haymakers
were at work in the meads.&nbsp; The manor-house, being opposite
them, frequently formed a peg for conversation during these
operations; and the doings of the squire, and the squire&rsquo;s
young wife, the curate&rsquo;s sister&mdash;who was at present
the admired of most of them, and the interest of all&mdash;met
with their due amount of criticism.</p>
<p>Rosa was happy, if ever woman could be said to be so.&nbsp;
She had not learnt the fate of her father, and sometimes
wondered&mdash;perhaps with a sense of relief&mdash;why he did
not write to her from his supposed home in Canada.&nbsp; Her
brother Joshua had been presented to a living in a small town,
shortly after her marriage, and Cornelius had thereupon succeeded
to the vacant curacy of Narrobourne.</p>
<p>These two had awaited in deep suspense the discovery of their
father&rsquo;s body; and yet the discovery had not been
made.&nbsp; Every day they expected a man or a boy to run up from
the meads with the intelligence; but he had never come.&nbsp;
Days had accumulated to weeks and months; the wedding had come
and gone: Joshua had tolled and read himself in at his new
parish; and never a shout of amazement over the
millwright&rsquo;s remains.</p>
<p>But now, in June, when they were mowing the meads, the hatches
had to be drawn and the water let out of its channels for the
convenience of the mowers.&nbsp; It was thus that the discovery
was made.&nbsp; A man, stooping low with his scythe, caught a
view of the culvert lengthwise, and saw something entangled in
the recently bared weeds of its bed.&nbsp; A day or two after
there was an inquest; but the body was unrecognizable.&nbsp; Fish
and flood had been busy with the millwright; he had no watch or
marked article which could be identified; and a verdict of the
accidental drowning of a person unknown settled the matter.</p>
<p>As the body was found in Narrobourne parish, there it had to
be buried.&nbsp; Cornelius wrote to Joshua, begging him to come
and read the service, or to send some one; he himself could not
do it.&nbsp; Rather than let in a stranger Joshua came, and
silently scanned the coroner&rsquo;s order handed him by the
undertaker:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I, Henry Giles, Coroner for the Mid-Division of Outer
Wessex, do hereby order the Burial of the Body now shown to the
Inquest Jury as the Body of an Adult Male Person Unknown . . .
,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>Joshua Halborough got through the service in some way, and
rejoined his brother Cornelius at his house.&nbsp; Neither
accepted an invitation to lunch at their sister&rsquo;s; they
wished to discuss parish matters together.&nbsp; In the afternoon
she came down, though they had already called on her, and had not
expected to see her again.&nbsp; Her bright eyes, brown hair,
flowery bonnet, lemon-coloured gloves, and flush beauty, were
like an irradiation into the apartment, which they in their gloom
could hardly bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot to tell you,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;of a
curious thing which happened to me a month or two before my
marriage&mdash;something which I have thought may have had a
connection with the accident to the poor man you have buried
to-day.&nbsp; It was on that evening I was at the manor-house
waiting for you to fetch me; I was in the winter-garden with
Albert, and we were sitting silent together, when we fancied we
heard a cry.&nbsp; We opened the door, and while Albert ran to
fetch his hat, leaving me standing there, the cry was repeated,
and my excited senses made me think I heard my own name.&nbsp;
When Albert came back all was silent, and we decided that it was
only a drunken shout, and not a cry for help.&nbsp; We both
forgot the incident, and it never has occurred to me till since
the funeral to-day that it might have been this stranger&rsquo;s
cry.&nbsp; The name of course was only fancy, or he might have
had a wife or child with a name something like mine, poor
man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When she was gone the brothers were silent till Cornelius
said, &lsquo;Now mark this, Joshua.&nbsp; Sooner or later
she&rsquo;ll know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From one of us.&nbsp; Do you think human hearts are
iron-cased safes, that you suppose we can keep this secret for
ever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I think they are, sometimes,&rsquo; said
Joshua.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; It will out.&nbsp; We shall tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, and ruin her&mdash;kill her?&nbsp; Disgrace her
children, and pull down the whole auspicious house of Fellmer
about our ears?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; May I&mdash;drown where he was
drowned before I do it!&nbsp; Never, never.&nbsp; Surely you can
say the same, Cornelius!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cornelius seemed fortified, and no more was said.&nbsp; For a
long time after that day he did not see Joshua, and before the
next year was out a son and heir was born to the Fellmers.&nbsp;
The villagers rang the three bells every evening for a week and
more, and were made merry by Mr. Fellmer&rsquo;s ale; and when
the christening came on Joshua paid Narrobourne another
visit.</p>
<p>Among all the people who assembled on that day the brother
clergymen were the least interested.&nbsp; Their minds were
haunted by a spirit in kerseymere in the evening they walked
together in the fields.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Joshua.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But here are you doing journey-work, Cornelius, and likely
to continue at it till the end of the day, as far as I can
see.&nbsp; I, too, with my petty living&mdash;what am I after
all? . . . To tell the truth, the Church is a poor forlorn hope
for people without influence, particularly when their enthusiasm
begins to flag.&nbsp; A social regenerator has a better chance
outside, where he is unhampered by dogma and tradition.&nbsp; As
for me, I would rather have gone on mending mills, with my crust
of bread and liberty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Almost automatically they had bent their steps along the
margin of the river; they now paused.&nbsp; They were standing on
the brink of the well-known weir.&nbsp; There were the hatches,
there was the culvert; they could see the pebbly bed of the
stream through the pellucid water.&nbsp; The notes of the
church-bells were audible, still jangled by the enthusiastic
villagers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why see&mdash;it was there I hid his
walking-stick!&rsquo; said Joshua, looking towards the
sedge.&nbsp; The next moment, during a passing breeze, something
flashed white on the spot to which the attention of Cornelius was
drawn.</p>
<p>From the sedge rose a straight little silver-poplar, and it
was the leaves of this sapling which caused the flicker of
whiteness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His walking-stick has grown!&rsquo; Joshua added.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It was a rough one&mdash;cut from the hedge, I
remember.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At every puff of wind the tree turned white, till they could
not bear to look at it; and they walked away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see him every night,&rsquo; Cornelius murmured . . .
&lsquo;Ah, we read our <i>Hebrews</i> to little account,
Jos!&nbsp; &Upsilon;&pi;&#941;&mu;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;
&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;,
&alpha;&iota;&sigma;&chi;&upsilon;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf;
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&alpha;&sigmaf;.&nbsp;
To have endured the cross, despising the shame&mdash;there lay
greatness!&nbsp; But now I often feel that I should like to put
an end to trouble here in this self-same spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have thought of it myself,&rsquo; said Joshua.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps we shall, some day,&rsquo; murmured his
brother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Joshua moodily.</p>
<p>With that contingency to consider in the silence of their
nights and days they bent their steps homewards.</p>
<p><i>December</i> 1888.</p>
<h2>ON THE WESTERN CIRCUIT</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>The man who played the disturbing part in the two quiet lives
hereafter depicted&mdash;no great man, in any sense, by the
way&mdash;first had knowledge of them on an October evening, in
the city of Melchester.&nbsp; He had been standing in the Close,
vainly endeavouring to gain amid the darkness a glimpse of the
most homogeneous pile of medi&aelig;val architecture in England,
which towered and tapered from the damp and level sward in front
of him.&nbsp; While he stood the presence of the Cathedral walls
was revealed rather by the ear than by the eyes; he could not see
them, but they reflected sharply a roar of sound which entered
the Close by a street leading from the city square, and, falling
upon the building, was flung back upon him.</p>
<p>He postponed till the morrow his attempt to examine the
deserted edifice, and turned his attention to the noise.&nbsp; It
was compounded of steam barrel-organs, the clanging of gongs, the
ringing of hand-bells, the clack of rattles, and the
undistinguishable shouts of men.&nbsp; A lurid light hung in the
air in the direction of the tumult.&nbsp; Thitherward he went,
passing under the arched gateway, along a straight street, and
into the square.</p>
<p>He might have searched Europe over for a greater contrast
between juxtaposed scenes.&nbsp; The spectacle was that of the
eighth chasm of the Inferno as to colour and flame, and, as to
mirth, a development of the Homeric heaven.&nbsp; A smoky glare,
of the complexion of brass-filings, ascended from the fiery
tongues of innumerable naphtha lamps affixed to booths, stalls,
and other temporary erections which crowded the spacious
market-square.&nbsp; In front of this irradiation scores of human
figures, more or less in profile, were darting athwart and
across, up, down, and around, like gnats against a sunset.</p>
<p>Their motions were so rhythmical that they seemed to be moved
by machinery.&nbsp; And it presently appeared that they were
moved by machinery indeed; the figures being those of the patrons
of swings, see-saws, flying-leaps, above all of the three steam
roundabouts which occupied the centre of the position.&nbsp; It
was from the latter that the din of steam-organs came.</p>
<p>Throbbing humanity in full light was, on second thoughts,
better than architecture in the dark.&nbsp; The young man,
lighting a short pipe, and putting his hat on one side and one
hand in his pocket, to throw himself into harmony with his new
environment, drew near to the largest and most patronized of the
steam circuses, as the roundabouts were called by their
owners.&nbsp; This was one of brilliant finish, and it was now in
full revolution.&nbsp; The musical instrument around which and to
whose tones the riders revolved, directed its trumpet-mouths of
brass upon the young man, and the long plate-glass mirrors set at
angles, which revolved with the machine, flashed the gyrating
personages and hobby horses kaleidoscopically into his eyes.</p>
<p>It could now be seen that he was unlike the majority of the
crowd.&nbsp; A gentlemanly young fellow, one of the species found
in large towns only, and London particularly, built on delicate
lines, well, though not fashionably dressed, he appeared to
belong to the professional class; he had nothing square or
practical about his look, much that was curvilinear and
sensuous.&nbsp; Indeed, some would have called him a man not
altogether typical of the middle-class male of a century wherein
sordid ambition is the master-passion that seems to be taking the
time-honoured place of love.</p>
<p>The revolving figures passed before his eyes with an
unexpected and quiet grace in a throng whose natural movements
did not suggest gracefulness or quietude as a rule.&nbsp; By some
contrivance there was imparted to each of the hobby-horses a
motion which was really the triumph and perfection of roundabout
inventiveness&mdash;a galloping rise and fall, so timed that, of
each pair of steeds, one was on the spring while the other was on
the pitch.&nbsp; The riders were quite fascinated by these equine
undulations in this most delightful holiday-game of our
times.&nbsp; There were riders as young as six, and as old as
sixty years, with every age between.&nbsp; At first it was
difficult to catch a personality, but by and by the
observer&rsquo;s eyes centred on the prettiest girl out of the
several pretty ones revolving.</p>
<p>It was not that one with the light frock and light hat whom he
had been at first attracted by; no, it was the one with the black
cape, grey skirt, light gloves and&mdash;no, not even she, but
the one behind her; she with the crimson skirt, dark jacket,
brown hat and brown gloves.&nbsp; Unmistakably that was the
prettiest girl.</p>
<p>Having finally selected her, this idle spectator studied her
as well as he was able during each of her brief transits across
his visual field.&nbsp; She was absolutely unconscious of
everything save the act of riding: her features were rapt in an
ecstatic dreaminess; for the moment she did not know her age or
her history or her lineaments, much less her troubles.&nbsp; He
himself was full of vague latter-day glooms and popular
melancholies, and it was a refreshing sensation to behold this
young thing then and there, absolutely as happy as if she were in
a Paradise.</p>
<p>Dreading the moment when the inexorable stoker, grimily
lurking behind the glittering rococo-work, should decide that
this set of riders had had their pennyworth, and bring the whole
concern of steam-engine, horses, mirrors, trumpets, drums,
cymbals, and such-like to pause and silence, he waited for her
every reappearance, glancing indifferently over the intervening
forms, including the two plainer girls, the old woman and child,
the two youngsters, the newly-married couple, the old man with a
clay pipe, the sparkish youth with a ring, the young ladies in
the chariot, the pair of journeyman-carpenters, and others, till
his select country beauty followed on again in her place.&nbsp;
He had never seen a fairer product of nature, and at each round
she made a deeper mark in his sentiments.&nbsp; The stoppage then
came, and the sighs of the riders were audible.</p>
<p>He moved round to the place at which he reckoned she would
alight; but she retained her seat.&nbsp; The empty saddles began
to refill, and she plainly was deciding to have another
turn.&nbsp; The young man drew up to the side of her steed, and
pleasantly asked her if she had enjoyed her ride.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes!&rsquo; she said, with dancing eyes.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It has been quite unlike anything I have ever felt in my
life before!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not difficult to fall into conversation with her.&nbsp;
Unreserved&mdash;too unreserved&mdash;by nature, she was not
experienced enough to be reserved by art, and after a little
coaxing she answered his remarks readily.&nbsp; She had come to
live in Melchester from a village on the Great Plain, and this
was the first time that she had ever seen a steam-circus; she
could not understand how such wonderful machines were made.&nbsp;
She had come to the city on the invitation of Mrs. Harnham, who
had taken her into her household to train her as a servant, if
she showed any aptitude.&nbsp; Mrs. Harnham was a young lady who
before she married had been Miss Edith White, living in the
country near the speaker&rsquo;s cottage; she was now very kind
to her through knowing her in childhood so well.&nbsp; She was
even taking the trouble to educate her.&nbsp; Mrs. Harnham was
the only friend she had in the world, and being without children
had wished to have her near her in preference to anybody else,
though she had only lately come; allowed her to do almost as she
liked, and to have a holiday whenever she asked for it.&nbsp; The
husband of this kind young lady was a rich wine-merchant of the
town, but Mrs. Harnham did not care much about him.&nbsp; In the
daytime you could see the house from where they were
talking.&nbsp; She, the speaker, liked Melchester better than the
lonely country, and she was going to have a new hat for next
Sunday that was to cost fifteen and ninepence.</p>
<p>Then she inquired of her acquaintance where he lived, and he
told her in London, that ancient and smoky city, where everybody
lived who lived at all, and died because they could not live
there.&nbsp; He came into Wessex two or three times a year for
professional reasons; he had arrived from Wintoncester yesterday,
and was going on into the next county in a day or two.&nbsp; For
one thing he did like the country better than the town, and it
was because it contained such girls as herself.</p>
<p>Then the pleasure-machine started again, and, to the
light-hearted girl, the figure of the handsome young man, the
market-square with its lights and crowd, the houses beyond, and
the world at large, began moving round as before, countermoving
in the revolving mirrors on her right hand, she being as it were
the fixed point in an undulating, dazzling, lurid universe, in
which loomed forward most prominently of all the form of her late
interlocutor.&nbsp; Each time that she approached the half of her
orbit that lay nearest him they gazed at each other with smiles,
and with that unmistakable expression which means so little at
the moment, yet so often leads up to passion, heart-ache, union,
disunion, devotion, overpopulation, drudgery, content,
resignation, despair.</p>
<p>When the horses slowed anew he stepped to her side and
proposed another heat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hang the expense for
once,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pay!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed till the tears came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you laugh, dear?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because&mdash;you are so genteel that you must have
plenty of money, and only say that for fun!&rsquo; she
returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha-ha!&rsquo; laughed the young man in unison, and
gallantly producing his money she was enabled to whirl on
again.</p>
<p>As he stood smiling there in the motley crowd, with his pipe
in his hand, and clad in the rough pea-jacket and wideawake that
he had put on for his stroll, who would have supposed him to be
Charles Bradford Raye, Esquire, stuff-gownsman, educated at
Wintoncester, called to the Bar at Lincoln&rsquo;s-Inn, now going
the Western Circuit, merely detained in Melchester by a small
arbitration after his brethren had moved on to the next
county-town?</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>The square was overlooked from its remoter corner by the house
of which the young girl had spoken, a dignified residence of
considerable size, having several windows on each floor.&nbsp;
Inside one of these, on the first floor, the apartment being a
large drawing-room, sat a lady, in appearance from twenty-eight
to thirty years of age.&nbsp; The blinds were still undrawn, and
the lady was absently surveying the weird scene without, her
cheek resting on her hand.&nbsp; The room was unlit from within,
but enough of the glare from the market-place entered it to
reveal the lady&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; She was what is called an
interesting creature rather than a handsome woman; dark-eyed,
thoughtful, and with sensitive lips.</p>
<p>A man sauntered into the room from behind and came
forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Edith, I didn&rsquo;t see you,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why are you sitting here in the dark?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am looking at the fair,&rsquo; replied the lady in a
languid voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh?&nbsp; Horrid nuisance every year!&nbsp; I wish it
could be put a stop to&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no accounting for
taste.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he gazed from the window with her, for politeness
sake, and then went out again.</p>
<p>In a few minutes she rang.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hasn&rsquo;t Anna come in?&rsquo; asked Mrs.
Harnham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No m&rsquo;m.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She ought to be in by this time.&nbsp; I meant her to
go for ten minutes only.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I go and look for her, m&rsquo;m?&rsquo; said the
house-maid alertly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; It is not necessary: she is a good girl and
will come soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, when the servant had gone Mrs. Harnham arose, went up
to her room, cloaked and bonneted herself, and proceeded
downstairs, where she found her husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to see the fair,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;and I
am going to look for Anna.&nbsp; I have made myself responsible
for her, and must see she comes to no harm.&nbsp; She ought to be
indoors.&nbsp; Will you come with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; I saw her on one of
those whirligig things, talking to her young man as I came
in.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll go if you wish, though I&rsquo;d rather
go a hundred miles the other way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then please do so.&nbsp; I shall come to no harm
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She left the house and entered the crowd which thronged the
market-place, where she soon discovered Anna, seated on the
revolving horse.&nbsp; As soon as it stopped Mrs. Harnham
advanced and said severely, &lsquo;Anna, how can you be such a
wild girl?&nbsp; You were only to be out for ten
minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anna looked blank, and the young man, who had dropped into the
background, came to her assistance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t blame her,&rsquo; he said
politely.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is my fault that she has stayed.&nbsp;
She looked so graceful on the horse that I induced her to go
round again.&nbsp; I assure you that she has been quite
safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case I&rsquo;ll leave her in your hands,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Harnham, turning to retrace her steps.</p>
<p>But this for the moment it was not so easy to do.&nbsp;
Something had attracted the crowd to a spot in their rear, and
the wine-merchant&rsquo;s wife, caught by its sway, found herself
pressed against Anna&rsquo;s acquaintance without power to move
away.&nbsp; Their faces were within a few inches of each other,
his breath fanned her cheek as well as Anna&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They
could do no other than smile at the accident; but neither spoke,
and each waited passively.&nbsp; Mrs. Harnham then felt a
man&rsquo;s hand clasping her fingers, and from the look of
consciousness on the young fellow&rsquo;s face she knew the hand
to be his: she also knew that from the position of the girl he
had no other thought than that the imprisoned hand was
Anna&rsquo;s.&nbsp; What prompted her to refrain from undeceiving
him she could hardly tell.&nbsp; Not content with holding the
hand, he playfully slipped two of his fingers inside her glove,
against her palm.&nbsp; Thus matters continued till the pressure
lessened; but several minutes passed before the crowd thinned
sufficiently to allow Mrs. Harnham to withdraw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did they get to know each other, I wonder?&rsquo;
she mused as she retreated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Anna is really very
forward&mdash;and he very wicked and nice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was so gently stirred with the stranger&rsquo;s manner and
voice, with the tenderness of his idle touch, that instead of
re-entering the house she turned back again and observed the pair
from a screened nook.&nbsp; Really she argued (being little less
impulsive than Anna herself) it was very excusable in Anna to
encourage him, however she might have contrived to make his
acquaintance; he was so gentlemanly, so fascinating, had such
beautiful eyes.&nbsp; The thought that he was several years her
junior produced a reasonless sigh.</p>
<p>At length the couple turned from the roundabout towards the
door of Mrs. Harnham&rsquo;s house, and the young man could be
heard saying that he would accompany her home.&nbsp; Anna, then,
had found a lover, apparently a very devoted one.&nbsp; Mrs.
Harnham was quite interested in him.&nbsp; When they drew near
the door of the wine-merchant&rsquo;s house, a comparatively
deserted spot by this time, they stood invisible for a little
while in the shadow of a wall, where they separated, Anna going
on to the entrance, and her acquaintance returning across the
square.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anna,&rsquo; said Mrs. Harnham, coming up.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking at you!&nbsp; That young man
kissed you at parting I am almost sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; stammered Anna; &lsquo;he said, if I
didn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;it would do me no harm, and, and, him a
great deal of good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I thought so!&nbsp; And he was a stranger till
to-night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet I warrant you told him your name and every thing
about yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He asked me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he didn&rsquo;t tell you his?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am, he did!&rsquo; cried Anna
victoriously.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is Charles Bradford, of
London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if he&rsquo;s respectable, of course I&rsquo;ve
nothing to say against your knowing him,&rsquo; remarked her
mistress, prepossessed, in spite of general principles, in the
young man&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I must reconsider all
that, if he attempts to renew your acquaintance.&nbsp; A
country-bred girl like you, who has never lived in Melchester
till this month, who had hardly ever seen a black-coated man till
you came here, to be so sharp as to capture a young Londoner like
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t capture him.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t do
anything,&rsquo; said Anna, in confusion.</p>
<p>When she was indoors and alone Mrs. Harnham thought what a
well-bred and chivalrous young man Anna&rsquo;s companion had
seemed.&nbsp; There had been a magic in his wooing touch of her
hand; and she wondered how he had come to be attracted by the
girl.</p>
<p>The next morning the emotional Edith Harnham went to the usual
week-day service in Melchester cathedral.&nbsp; In crossing the
Close through the fog she again perceived him who had interested
her the previous evening, gazing up thoughtfully at the
high-piled architecture of the nave: and as soon as she had taken
her seat he entered and sat down in a stall opposite hers.</p>
<p>He did not particularly heed her; but Mrs. Harnham was
continually occupying her eyes with him, and wondered more than
ever what had attracted him in her unfledged maid-servant.&nbsp;
The mistress was almost as unaccustomed as the maiden herself to
the end-of-the-age young man, or she might have wondered
less.&nbsp; Raye, having looked about him awhile, left abruptly,
without regard to the service that was proceeding; and Mrs.
Harnham&mdash;lonely, impressionable creature that she
was&mdash;took no further interest in praising the Lord.&nbsp;
She wished she had married a London man who knew the subtleties
of love-making as they were evidently known to him who had
mistakenly caressed her hand.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>The calendar at Melchester had been light, occupying the court
only a few hours; and the assizes at Casterbridge, the next
county-town on the Western Circuit, having no business for Raye,
he had not gone thither.&nbsp; At the next town after that they
did not open till the following Monday, trials to begin on
Tuesday morning.&nbsp; In the natural order of things Raye would
have arrived at the latter place on Monday afternoon; but it was
not till the middle of Wednesday that his gown and grey wig,
curled in tiers, in the best fashion of Assyrian bas-reliefs,
were seen blowing and bobbing behind him as he hastily walked up
the High Street from his lodgings.&nbsp; But though he entered
the assize building there was nothing for him to do, and sitting
at the blue baize table in the well of the court, he mended pens
with a mind far away from the case in progress.&nbsp; Thoughts of
unpremeditated conduct, of which a week earlier he would not have
believed himself capable, threw him into a mood of dissatisfied
depression.</p>
<p>He had contrived to see again the pretty rural maiden Anna,
the day after the fair, had walked out of the city with her to
the earthworks of Old Melchester, and feeling a violent fancy for
her, had remained in Melchester all Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday;
by persuasion obtaining walks and meetings with the girl six or
seven times during the interval; had in brief won her, body and
soul.</p>
<p>He supposed it must have been owing to the seclusion in which
he had lived of late in town that he had given way so
unrestrainedly to a passion for an artless creature whose
inexperience had, from the first, led her to place herself
unreservedly in his hands.&nbsp; Much he deplored trifling with
her feelings for the sake of a passing desire; and he could only
hope that she might not live to suffer on his account.</p>
<p>She had begged him to come to her again; entreated him;
wept.&nbsp; He had promised that he would do so, and he meant to
carry out that promise.&nbsp; He could not desert her now.&nbsp;
Awkward as such unintentional connections were, the interspace of
a hundred miles&mdash;which to a girl of her limited capabilities
was like a thousand&mdash;would effectually hinder this summer
fancy from greatly encumbering his life; while thought of her
simple love might do him the negative good of keeping him from
idle pleasures in town when he wished to work hard.&nbsp; His
circuit journeys would take him to Melchester three or four times
a year; and then he could always see her.</p>
<p>The pseudonym, or rather partial name, that he had given her
as his before knowing how far the acquaintance was going to carry
him, had been spoken on the spur of the moment, without any
ulterior intention whatever.&nbsp; He had not afterwards
disturbed Anna&rsquo;s error, but on leaving her he had felt
bound to give her an address at a stationer&rsquo;s not far from
his chambers, at which she might write to him under the initials
&lsquo;C. B.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In due time Raye returned to his London abode, having called
at Melchester on his way and spent a few additional hours with
his fascinating child of nature.&nbsp; In town he lived
monotonously every day.&nbsp; Often he and his rooms were
enclosed by a tawny fog from all the world besides, and when he
lighted the gas to read or write by, his situation seemed so
unnatural that he would look into the fire and think of that
trusting girl at Melchester again and again.&nbsp; Often,
oppressed by absurd fondness for her, he would enter the dim
religious nave of the Law Courts by the north door, elbow other
juniors habited like himself, and like him unretained; edge
himself into this or that crowded court where a sensational case
was going on, just as if he were in it, though the police
officers at the door knew as well as he knew himself that he had
no more concern with the business in hand than the patient idlers
at the gallery-door outside, who had waited to enter since eight
in the morning because, like him, they belonged to the classes
that live on expectation.&nbsp; But he would do these things to
no purpose, and think how greatly the characters in such scenes
contrasted with the pink and breezy Anna.</p>
<p>An unexpected feature in that peasant maiden&rsquo;s conduct
was that she had not as yet written to him, though he had told
her she might do so if she wished.&nbsp; Surely a young creature
had never before been so reticent in such circumstances.&nbsp; At
length he sent her a brief line, positively requesting her to
write.&nbsp; There was no answer by the return post, but the day
after a letter in a neat feminine hand, and bearing the
Melchester post-mark, was handed to him by the stationer.</p>
<p>The fact alone of its arrival was sufficient to satisfy his
imaginative sentiment.&nbsp; He was not anxious to open the
epistle, and in truth did not begin to read it for nearly
half-an-hour, anticipating readily its terms of passionate
retrospect and tender adjuration.&nbsp; When at last he turned
his feet to the fireplace and unfolded the sheet, he was
surprised and pleased to find that neither extravagance nor
vulgarity was there.&nbsp; It was the most charming little
missive he had ever received from woman.&nbsp; To be sure the
language was simple and the ideas were slight; but it was so
self-possessed; so purely that of a young girl who felt her
womanhood to be enough for her dignity that he read it through
twice.&nbsp; Four sides were filled, and a few lines written
across, after the fashion of former days; the paper, too, was
common, and not of the latest shade and surface.&nbsp; But what
of those things?&nbsp; He had received letters from women who
were fairly called ladies, but never so sensible, so human a
letter as this.&nbsp; He could not single out any one sentence
and say it was at all remarkable or clever; the <i>ensemble</i>
of the letter it was which won him; and beyond the one request
that he would write or come to her again soon there was nothing
to show her sense of a claim upon him.</p>
<p>To write again and develop a correspondence was the last thing
Raye would have preconceived as his conduct in such a situation;
yet he did send a short, encouraging line or two, signed with his
pseudonym, in which he asked for another letter, and cheeringly
promised that he would try to see her again on some near day, and
would never forget how much they had been to each other during
their short acquaintance.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>To return now to the moment at which Anna, at Melchester, had
received Raye&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>It had been put into her own hand by the postman on his
morning rounds.&nbsp; She flushed down to her neck on receipt of
it, and turned it over and over.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is mine?&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, yes, can&rsquo;t you see it is?&rsquo; said the
postman, smiling as he guessed the nature of the document and the
cause of the confusion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, of course!&rsquo; replied Anna, looking at the
letter, forcedly tittering, and blushing still more.</p>
<p>Her look of embarrassment did not leave her with the
postman&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp; She opened the envelope, kissed
its contents, put away the letter in her pocket, and remained
musing till her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>A few minutes later she carried up a cup of tea to Mrs.
Harnham in her bed-chamber.&nbsp; Anna&rsquo;s mistress looked at
her, and said: &lsquo;How dismal you seem this morning,
Anna.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not dismal, I&rsquo;m glad; only
I&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; She stopped to stifle a sob.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter&mdash;and what good is it to
me, if I can&rsquo;t read a word in it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll read it, child, if
necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But this is from somebody&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want
anybody to read it but myself!&rsquo; Anna murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not tell anybody.&nbsp; Is it from that young
man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think so.&rsquo; Anna slowly produced the letter,
saying: &lsquo;Then will you read it to me,
ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was the secret of Anna&rsquo;s embarrassment and
flutterings.&nbsp; She could neither read nor write.&nbsp; She
had grown up under the care of an aunt by marriage, at one of the
lonely hamlets on the Great Mid-Wessex Plain where, even in days
of national education, there had been no school within a distance
of two miles.&nbsp; Her aunt was an ignorant woman; there had
been nobody to investigate Anna&rsquo;s circumstances, nobody to
care about her learning the rudiments; though, as often in such
cases, she had been well fed and clothed and not unkindly
treated.&nbsp; Since she had come to live at Melchester with Mrs.
Harnham, the latter, who took a kindly interest in the girl, had
taught her to speak correctly, in which accomplishment Anna
showed considerable readiness, as is not unusual with the
illiterate; and soon became quite fluent in the use of her
mistress&rsquo;s phraseology.&nbsp; Mrs. Harnham also insisted
upon her getting a spelling and copy book, and beginning to
practise in these.&nbsp; Anna was slower in this branch of her
education, and meanwhile here was the letter.</p>
<p>Edith Harnham&rsquo;s large dark eyes expressed some interest
in the contents, though, in her character of mere interpreter,
she threw into her tone as much as she could of mechanical
passiveness.&nbsp; She read the short epistle on to its
concluding sentence, which idly requested Anna to send him a
tender answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now&mdash;you&rsquo;ll do it for me, won&rsquo;t you,
dear mistress?&rsquo; said Anna eagerly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
you&rsquo;ll do it as well as ever you can, please?&nbsp; Because
I couldn&rsquo;t bear him to think I am not able to do it
myself.&nbsp; I should sink into the earth with shame if he knew
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>From some words in the letter Mrs. Harnham was led to ask
questions, and the answers she received confirmed her
suspicions.&nbsp; Deep concern filled Edith&rsquo;s heart at
perceiving how the girl had committed her happiness to the issue
of this new-sprung attachment.&nbsp; She blamed herself for not
interfering in a flirtation which had resulted so seriously for
the poor little creature in her charge; though at the time of
seeing the pair together she had a feeling that it was hardly
within her province to nip young affection in the bud.&nbsp;
However, what was done could not be undone, and it behoved her
now, as Anna&rsquo;s only protector, to help her as much as she
could.&nbsp; To Anna&rsquo;s eager request that she, Mrs.
Harnham, should compose and write the answer to this young London
man&rsquo;s letter, she felt bound to accede, to keep alive his
attachment to the girl if possible; though in other circumstances
she might have suggested the cook as an amanuensis.</p>
<p>A tender reply was thereupon concocted, and set down in Edith
Harnham&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; This letter it had been which Raye
had received and delighted in.&nbsp; Written in the presence of
Anna it certainly was, and on Anna&rsquo;s humble note-paper, and
in a measure indited by the young girl; but the life, the spirit,
the individuality, were Edith Harnham&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you at least put your name yourself?&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;You can manage to write that by this
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Anna, shrinking back.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I should do it so bad.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d be ashamed of me,
and never see me again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The note, so prettily requesting another from him, had, as we
have seen, power enough in its pages to bring one.&nbsp; He
declared it to be such a pleasure to hear from her that she must
write every week.&nbsp; The same process of manufacture was
accordingly repeated by Anna and her mistress, and continued for
several weeks in succession; each letter being penned and
suggested by Edith, the girl standing by; the answer read and
commented on by Edith, Anna standing by and listening again.</p>
<p>Late on a winter evening, after the dispatch of the sixth
letter, Mrs. Harnham was sitting alone by the remains of her
fire.&nbsp; Her husband had retired to bed, and she had fallen
into that fixity of musing which takes no count of hour or
temperature.&nbsp; The state of mind had been brought about in
Edith by a strange thing which she had done that day.&nbsp; For
the first time since Raye&rsquo;s visit Anna had gone to stay
over a night or two with her cottage friends on the Plain, and in
her absence had arrived, out of its time, a letter from
Raye.&nbsp; To this Edith had replied on her own responsibility,
from the depths of her own heart, without waiting for her
maid&rsquo;s collaboration.&nbsp; The luxury of writing to him
what would be known to no consciousness but his was great, and
she had indulged herself therein.</p>
<p>Why was it a luxury?</p>
<p>Edith Harnham led a lonely life.&nbsp; Influenced by the
belief of the British parent that a bad marriage with its
aversions is better than free womanhood with its interests,
dignity, and leisure, she had consented to marry the elderly
wine-merchant as a <i>pis aller</i>, at the age of
seven-and-twenty&mdash;some three years before this date&mdash;to
find afterwards that she had made a mistake.&nbsp; That contract
had left her still a woman whose deeper nature had never been
stirred.</p>
<p>She was now clearly realizing that she had become possessed to
the bottom of her soul with the image of a man to whom she was
hardly so much as a name.&nbsp; From the first he had attracted
her by his looks and voice; by his tender touch; and, with these
as generators, the writing of letter after letter and the reading
of their soft answers had insensibly developed on her side an
emotion which fanned his; till there had resulted a magnetic
reciprocity between the correspondents, notwithstanding that one
of them wrote in a character not her own.&nbsp; That he had been
able to seduce another woman in two days was his crowning though
unrecognized fascination for her as the she-animal.</p>
<p>They were her own impassioned and pent-up ideas&mdash;lowered
to monosyllabic phraseology in order to keep up the
disguise&mdash;that Edith put into letters signed with another
name, much to the shallow Anna&rsquo;s delight, who, unassisted,
could not for the world have conceived such pretty fancies for
winning him, even had she been able to write them.&nbsp; Edith
found that it was these, her own foisted-in sentiments, to which
the young barrister mainly responded.&nbsp; The few sentences
occasionally added from Anna&rsquo;s own lips made apparently no
impression upon him.</p>
<p>The letter-writing in her absence Anna never discovered; but
on her return the next morning she declared she wished to see her
lover about something at once, and begged Mrs. Harnham to ask him
to come.</p>
<p>There was a strange anxiety in her manner which did not escape
Mrs. Harnham, and ultimately resolved itself into a flood of
tears.&nbsp; Sinking down at Edith&rsquo;s knees, she made
confession that the result of her relations with her lover it
would soon become necessary to disclose.</p>
<p>Edith Harnham was generous enough to be very far from inclined
to cast Anna adrift at this conjuncture.&nbsp; No true woman ever
is so inclined from her own personal point of view, however
prompt she may be in taking such steps to safeguard those dear to
her.&nbsp; Although she had written to Raye so short a time
previously, she instantly penned another Anna-note hinting
clearly though delicately the state of affairs.</p>
<p>Raye replied by a hasty line to say how much he was affected
by her news: he felt that he must run down to see her almost
immediately.</p>
<p>But a week later the girl came to her mistress&rsquo;s room
with another note, which on being read informed her that after
all he could not find time for the journey.&nbsp; Anna was broken
with grief; but by Mrs. Harnham&rsquo;s counsel strictly
refrained from hurling at him the reproaches and bitterness
customary from young women so situated.&nbsp; One thing was
imperative: to keep the young man&rsquo;s romantic interest in
her alive.&nbsp; Rather therefore did Edith, in the name of her
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>, request him on no account to be
distressed about the looming event, and not to inconvenience
himself to hasten down.&nbsp; She desired above everything to be
no weight upon him in his career, no clog upon his high
activities.&nbsp; She had wished him to know what had befallen:
he was to dismiss it again from his mind.&nbsp; Only he must
write tenderly as ever, and when he should come again on the
spring circuit it would be soon enough to discuss what had better
be done.</p>
<p>It may well be supposed that Anna&rsquo;s own feelings had not
been quite in accord with these generous expressions; but the
mistress&rsquo;s judgment had ruled, and Anna had
acquiesced.&nbsp; &lsquo;All I want is that <i>niceness</i> you
can so well put into your letters, my dear, dear mistress, and
that I can&rsquo;t for the life o&rsquo; me make up out of my own
head; though I mean the same thing and feel it exactly when
you&rsquo;ve written it down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the letter had been sent off, and Edith Harnham was left
alone, she bowed herself on the back of her chair and wept.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish it was mine&mdash;I wish it was!&rsquo; she
murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet how can I say such a wicked
thing!&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>The letter moved Raye considerably when it reached him.&nbsp;
The intelligence itself had affected him less than her unexpected
manner of treating him in relation to it.&nbsp; The absence of
any word of reproach, the devotion to his interests, the
self-sacrifice apparent in every line, all made up a nobility of
character that he had never dreamt of finding in womankind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;God forgive me!&rsquo; he said tremulously.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have been a wicked wretch.&nbsp; I did not know she was
such a treasure as this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He reassured her instantly; declaring that he would not of
course desert her, that he would provide a home for her
somewhere.&nbsp; Meanwhile she was to stay where she was as long
as her mistress would allow her.</p>
<p>But a misfortune supervened in this direction.&nbsp; Whether
an inkling of Anna&rsquo;s circumstances reached the knowledge of
Mrs. Harnham&rsquo;s husband or not cannot be said, but the girl
was compelled, in spite of Edith&rsquo;s entreaties, to leave the
house.&nbsp; By her own choice she decided to go back for a while
to the cottage on the Plain.&nbsp; This arrangement led to a
consultation as to how the correspondence should be carried on;
and in the girl&rsquo;s inability to continue personally what had
been begun in her name, and in the difficulty of their acting in
concert as heretofore, she requested Mrs. Harnham&mdash;the only
well-to-do friend she had in the world&mdash;to receive the
letters and reply to them off-hand, sending them on afterwards to
herself on the Plain, where she might at least get some neighbour
to read them to her, if a trustworthy one could be met
with.&nbsp; Anna and her box then departed for the Plain.</p>
<p>Thus it befel that Edith Harnham found herself in the strange
position of having to correspond, under no supervision by the
real woman, with a man not her husband, in terms which were
virtually those of a wife, concerning a condition that was not
Edith&rsquo;s at all; the man being one for whom, mainly through
the sympathies involved in playing this part, she secretly
cherished a predilection, subtle and imaginative truly, but
strong and absorbing.&nbsp; She opened each letter, read it as if
intended for herself, and replied from the promptings of her own
heart and no other.</p>
<p>Throughout this correspondence, carried on in the girl&rsquo;s
absence, the high-strung Edith Harnham lived in the ecstasy of
fancy; the vicarious intimacy engendered such a flow of
passionateness as was never exceeded.&nbsp; For conscience&rsquo;
sake Edith at first sent on each of his letters to Anna, and even
rough copies of her replies; but later on these so-called copies
were much abridged, and many letters on both sides were not sent
on at all.</p>
<p>Though selfish, and, superficially at least, infested with the
self-indulgent vices of artificial society, there was a
substratum of honesty and fairness in Raye&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; He had really a tender regard for the country
girl, and it grew more tender than ever when he found her
apparently capable of expressing the deepest sensibilities in the
simplest words.&nbsp; He meditated, he wavered; and finally
resolved to consult his sister, a maiden lady much older than
himself, of lively sympathies and good intent.&nbsp; In making
this confidence he showed her some of the letters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She seems fairly educated,&rsquo; Miss Raye
observed.&nbsp; &lsquo;And bright in ideas.&nbsp; She expresses
herself with a taste that must be innate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; She writes very prettily, doesn&rsquo;t she,
thanks to these elementary schools?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One is drawn out towards her, in spite of one&rsquo;s
self, poor thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The upshot of the discussion was that though he had not been
directly advised to do it, Raye wrote, in his real name, what he
would never have decided to write on his own responsibility;
namely that he could not live without her, and would come down in
the spring and shelve her looming difficulty by marrying her.</p>
<p>This bold acceptance of the situation was made known to Anna
by Mrs. Harnham driving out immediately to the cottage on the
Plain.&nbsp; Anna jumped for joy like a little child.&nbsp; And
poor, crude directions for answering appropriately were given to
Edith Harnham, who on her return to the city carried them out
with warm intensification.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O!&rsquo; she groaned, as she threw down the pen.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Anna&mdash;poor good little fool&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t
intelligence enough to appreciate him!&nbsp; How should
she?&nbsp; While I&mdash;don&rsquo;t bear his child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was now February.&nbsp; The correspondence had continued
altogether for four months; and the next letter from Raye
contained incidentally a statement of his position and
prospects.&nbsp; He said that in offering to wed her he had, at
first, contemplated the step of retiring from a profession which
hitherto had brought him very slight emolument, and which, to
speak plainly, he had thought might be difficult of practice
after his union with her.&nbsp; But the unexpected mines of
brightness and warmth that her letters had disclosed to be
lurking in her sweet nature had led him to abandon that somewhat
sad prospect.&nbsp; He felt sure that, with her powers of
development, after a little private training in the social forms
of London under his supervision, and a little help from a
governess if necessary, she would make as good a professional
man&rsquo;s wife as could be desired, even if he should rise to
the woolsack.&nbsp; Many a Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s wife had been
less intuitively a lady than she had shown herself to be in her
lines to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O&mdash;poor fellow, poor fellow!&rsquo; mourned Edith
Harnham.</p>
<p>Her distress now raged as high as her infatuation.&nbsp; It
was she who had wrought him to this pitch&mdash;to a marriage
which meant his ruin; yet she could not, in mercy to her maid, do
anything to hinder his plan.&nbsp; Anna was coming to Melchester
that week, but she could hardly show the girl this last reply
from the young man; it told too much of the second individuality
that had usurped the place of the first.</p>
<p>Anna came, and her mistress took her into her own room for
privacy.&nbsp; Anna began by saying with some anxiety that she
was glad the wedding was so near.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Anna!&rsquo; replied Mrs. Harnham.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
think we must tell him all&mdash;that I have been doing your
writing for you?&mdash;lest he should not know it till after you
become his wife, and it might lead to dissension and
recriminations&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O mis&rsquo;ess, dear mis&rsquo;ess&mdash;please
don&rsquo;t tell him now!&rsquo; cried Anna in distress.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you were to do it, perhaps he would not marry me; and
what should I do then?&nbsp; It would be terrible what would come
to me!&nbsp; And I am getting on with my writing, too.&nbsp; I
have brought with me the copybook you were so good as to give me,
and I practise every day, and though it is so, so hard, I shall
do it well at last, I believe, if I keep on trying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Edith looked at the copybook.&nbsp; The copies had been set by
herself, and such progress as the girl had made was in the way of
grotesque facsimile of her mistress&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; But even
if Edith&rsquo;s flowing caligraphy were reproduced the
inspiration would be another thing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do it so beautifully,&rsquo; continued Anna,
&lsquo;and say all that I want to say so much better than I could
say it, that I do hope you won&rsquo;t leave me in the lurch just
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; replied the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
I&mdash;but I thought I ought not to go on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her strong desire to confide her sentiments led Edith to
answer truly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because of its effect upon me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> have any!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because you are married already!&rsquo; said Anna with
lucid simplicity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said her mistress
hastily; yet glad, despite her conscience, that two or three
outpourings still remained to her.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you must
concentrate your attention on writing your name as I write it
here.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p>Soon Raye wrote about the wedding.&nbsp; Having decided to
make the best of what he feared was a piece of romantic folly, he
had acquired more zest for the grand experiment.&nbsp; He wished
the ceremony to be in London, for greater privacy.&nbsp; Edith
Harnham would have preferred it at Melchester; Anna was
passive.&nbsp; His reasoning prevailed, and Mrs. Harnham threw
herself with mournful zeal into the preparations for Anna&rsquo;s
departure.&nbsp; In a last desperate feeling that she must at
every hazard be in at the death of her dream, and see once again
the man who by a species of telepathy had exercised such an
influence on her, she offered to go up with Anna and be with her
through the ceremony&mdash;&lsquo;to see the end of her,&rsquo;
as her mistress put it with forced gaiety; an offer which the
girl gratefully accepted; for she had no other friend capable of
playing the part of companion and witness, in the presence of a
gentlemanly bridegroom, in such a way as not to hasten an opinion
that he had made an irremediable social blunder.</p>
<p>It was a muddy morning in March when Raye alighted from a
four-wheel cab at the door of a registry-office in the S.W.
district of London, and carefully handed down Anna and her
companion Mrs. Harnham.&nbsp; Anna looked attractive in the
somewhat fashionable clothes which Mrs. Harnham had helped her to
buy, though not quite so attractive as, an innocent child, she
had appeared in her country gown on the back of the wooden horse
at Melchester Fair.</p>
<p>Mrs. Harnham had come up this morning by an early train, and a
young man&mdash;a friend of Raye&rsquo;s&mdash;having met them at
the door, all four entered the registry-office together.&nbsp;
Till an hour before this time Raye had never known the
wine-merchant&rsquo;s wife, except at that first casual
encounter, and in the flutter of the performance before them he
had little opportunity for more than a brief acquaintance.&nbsp;
The contract of marriage at a registry is soon got through; but
somehow, during its progress, Raye discovered a strange and
secret gravitation between himself and Anna&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>The formalities of the wedding&mdash;or rather ratification of
a previous union&mdash;being concluded, the four went in one cab
to Raye&rsquo;s lodgings, newly taken in a new suburb in
preference to a house, the rent of which he could ill afford just
then.&nbsp; Here Anna cut the little cake which Raye had bought
at a pastrycook&rsquo;s on his way home from Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
the night before.&nbsp; But she did not do much besides.&nbsp;
Raye&rsquo;s friend was obliged to depart almost immediately, and
when he had left the only ones virtually present were Edith and
Raye who exchanged ideas with much animation.&nbsp; The
conversation was indeed theirs only, Anna being as a domestic
animal who humbly heard but understood not.&nbsp; Raye seemed
startled in awakening to this fact, and began to feel
dissatisfied with her inadequacy.</p>
<p>At last, more disappointed than he cared to own, he said,
&lsquo;Mrs. Harnham, my darling is so flurried that she
doesn&rsquo;t know what she is doing or saying.&nbsp; I see that
after this event a little quietude will be necessary before she
gives tongue to that tender philosophy which she used to treat me
to in her letters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They had planned to start early that afternoon for Knollsea,
to spend the few opening days of their married life there, and as
the hour for departure was drawing near Raye asked his wife if
she would go to the writing-desk in the next room and scribble a
little note to his sister, who had been unable to attend through
indisposition, informing her that the ceremony was over, thanking
her for her little present, and hoping to know her well now that
she was the writer&rsquo;s sister as well as Charles&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say it in the pretty poetical way you know so well how
to adopt,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;for I want you particularly to
win her, and both of you to be dear friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anna looked uneasy, but departed to her task, Raye remaining
to talk to their guest.&nbsp; Anna was a long while absent, and
her husband suddenly rose and went to her.</p>
<p>He found her still bending over the writing-table, with tears
brimming up in her eyes; and he looked down upon the sheet of
note-paper with some interest, to discover with what tact she had
expressed her good-will in the delicate circumstances.&nbsp; To
his surprise she had progressed but a few lines, in the
characters and spelling of a child of eight, and with the ideas
of a goose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anna,&rsquo; he said, staring; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It only means&mdash;that I can&rsquo;t do it any
better!&rsquo; she answered, through her tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh?&nbsp; Nonsense!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she insisted, with miserable,
sobbing hardihood.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
write those letters, Charles!&nbsp; I only told <i>her</i> what
to write!&nbsp; And not always that!&nbsp; But I am learning, O
so fast, my dear, dear husband!&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll forgive
me, won&rsquo;t you, for not telling you before?&rsquo;&nbsp; She
slid to her knees, abjectly clasped his waist and laid her face
against him.</p>
<p>He stood a few moments, raised her, abruptly turned, and shut
the door upon her, rejoining Edith in the drawing-room.&nbsp; She
saw that something untoward had been discovered, and their eyes
remained fixed on each other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do I guess rightly?&rsquo; he asked, with wan
quietude.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>You</i> were her scribe through all
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was necessary,&rsquo; said Edith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she dictate every word you ever wrote to
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not every word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fact, very little?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wrote a great part of those pages every week from
your own conceptions, though in her name!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you wrote many of the letters when you were
alone, without communication with her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the bookcase, and leant with his hand over his
face; and Edith, seeing his distress, became white as a
sheet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have deceived me&mdash;ruined me!&rsquo; he
murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t say it!&rsquo; she cried in her anguish,
jumping up and putting her hand on his shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t bear that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Delighting me deceptively!&nbsp; Why did you do
it&mdash;<i>why</i> did you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I began doing it in kindness to her!&nbsp; How could I
do otherwise than try to save such a simple girl from
misery?&nbsp; But I admit that I continued it for pleasure to
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Raye looked up.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did it give you
pleasure?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must not tell,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>He continued to regard her, and saw that her lips suddenly
began to quiver under his scrutiny, and her eyes to fill and
droop.&nbsp; She started aside, and said that she must go to the
station to catch the return train: could a cab be called
immediately?</p>
<p>But Raye went up to her, and took her unresisting hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, to think of such a thing as this!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, you and I are
friends&mdash;lovers&mdash;devoted lovers&mdash;by
correspondence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Plainly more.&nbsp; It is no use blinking that.&nbsp;
Legally I have married her&mdash;God help us both!&mdash;in soul
and spirit I have married you, and no other woman in the
world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I will not hush!&nbsp; Why should you try to
disguise the full truth, when you have already owned half of
it?&nbsp; Yes, it is between you and me that the bond
is&mdash;not between me and her!&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll say no
more.&nbsp; But, O my cruel one, I think I have one claim upon
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not say what, and he drew her towards him, and bent
over her.&nbsp; &lsquo;If it was all pure invention in those
letters,&rsquo; he said emphatically, &lsquo;give me your cheek
only.&nbsp; If you meant what you said, let it be lips.&nbsp; It
is for the first and last time, remember!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She put up her mouth, and he kissed her long.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
forgive me?&rsquo; she said crying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you are ruined!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What matter!&rsquo; he said shrugging his
shoulders.&nbsp; &lsquo;It serves me right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She withdrew, wiped her eyes, entered and bade good-bye to
Anna, who had not expected her to go so soon, and was still
wrestling with the letter.&nbsp; Raye followed Edith downstairs,
and in three minutes she was in a hansom driving to the Waterloo
station.</p>
<p>He went back to his wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never mind the letter,
Anna, to-day,&rsquo; he said gently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Put on your
things.&nbsp; We, too, must be off shortly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The simple girl, upheld by the sense that she was indeed
married, showed her delight at finding that he was as kind as
ever after the disclosure.&nbsp; She did not know that before his
eyes he beheld as it were a galley, in which he, the fastidious
urban, was chained to work for the remainder of his life, with
her, the unlettered peasant, chained to his side.</p>
<p>Edith travelled back to Melchester that day with a face that
showed the very stupor of grief; her lips still tingling from the
desperate pressure of his kiss.&nbsp; The end of her impassioned
dream had come.&nbsp; When at dusk she reached the Melchester
station her husband was there to meet her, but in his
perfunctoriness and her preoccupation they did not see each
other, and she went out of the station alone.</p>
<p>She walked mechanically homewards without calling a fly.&nbsp;
Entering, she could not bear the silence of the house, and went
up in the dark to where Anna had slept, where she remained
thinking awhile.&nbsp; She then returned to the drawing-room, and
not knowing what she did, crouched down upon the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have ruined him!&rsquo; she kept repeating.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have ruined him; because I would not deal treacherously
towards her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the course of half an hour a figure opened the door of the
apartment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; she said, starting
up, for it was dark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your husband&mdash;who should it be?&rsquo; said the
worthy merchant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;my husband!&mdash;I forgot I had a
husband!&rsquo; she whispered to herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I missed you at the station,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Did you see Anna safely tied up?&nbsp; I hope so, for
&rsquo;twas time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;Anna is married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Simultaneously with Edith&rsquo;s journey home Anna and her
husband were sitting at the opposite windows of a second-class
carriage which sped along to Knollsea.&nbsp; In his hand was a
pocket-book full of creased sheets closely written over.&nbsp;
Unfolding them one after another he read them in silence, and
sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing, dear Charles?&rsquo; she said
timidly from the other window, and drew nearer to him as if he
were a god.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reading over all those sweet letters to me signed
&ldquo;Anna,&rdquo;&rsquo; he replied with dreary
resignation.</p>
<p><i>Autumn</i> 1891.</p>
<h2>TO PLEASE HIS WIFE</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>The interior of St. James&rsquo;s Church, in Havenpool Town,
was slowly darkening under the close clouds of a winter
afternoon.&nbsp; It was Sunday: service had just ended, the face
of the parson in the pulpit was buried in his hands, and the
congregation, with a cheerful sigh of release, were rising from
their knees to depart.</p>
<p>For the moment the stillness was so complete that the surging
of the sea could be heard outside the harbour-bar.&nbsp; Then it
was broken by the footsteps of the clerk going towards the west
door to open it in the usual manner for the exit of the
assembly.&nbsp; Before, however, he had reached the doorway, the
latch was lifted from without, and the dark figure of a man in a
sailor&rsquo;s garb appeared against the light.</p>
<p>The clerk stepped aside, the sailor closed the door gently
behind him, and advanced up the nave till he stood at the
chancel-step.&nbsp; The parson looked up from the private little
prayer which, after so many for the parish, he quite fairly took
for himself; rose to his feet, and stared at the intruder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said the sailor,
addressing the minister in a voice distinctly audible to all the
congregation.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have come here to offer thanks for
my narrow escape from shipwreck.&nbsp; I am given to understand
that it is a proper thing to do, if you have no
objection?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The parson, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, said hesitatingly,
&lsquo;I have no objection; certainly.&nbsp; It is usual to
mention any such wish before service, so that the proper words
may be used in the General Thanksgiving.&nbsp; But, if you wish,
we can read from the form for use after a storm at
sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, sure; I ain&rsquo;t particular,&rsquo; said the
sailor.</p>
<p>The clerk thereupon directed the sailor to the page in the
prayer-book where the collect of thanksgiving would be found, and
the rector began reading it, the sailor kneeling where he stood,
and repeating it after him word by word in a distinct
voice.&nbsp; The people, who had remained agape and motionless at
the proceeding, mechanically knelt down likewise; but they
continued to regard the isolated form of the sailor who, in the
precise middle of the chancel-step, remained fixed on his knees,
facing the east, his hat beside him, his hands joined, and he
quite unconscious of his appearance in their regard.</p>
<p>When his thanksgiving had come to an end he rose; the people
rose also, and all went out of church together.&nbsp; As soon as
the sailor emerged, so that the remaining daylight fell upon his
face, old inhabitants began to recognize him as no other than
Shadrach Jolliffe, a young man who had not been seen at Havenpool
for several years.&nbsp; A son of the town, his parents had died
when he was quite young, on which account he had early gone to
sea, in the Newfoundland trade.</p>
<p>He talked with this and that townsman as he walked, informing
them that, since leaving his native place years before, he had
become captain and owner of a small coasting-ketch, which had
providentially been saved from the gale as well as himself.&nbsp;
Presently he drew near to two girls who were going out of the
churchyard in front of him; they had been sitting in the nave at
his entry, and had watched his doings with deep interest,
afterwards discussing him as they moved out of church
together.&nbsp; One was a slight and gentle creature, the other a
tall, large-framed, deliberative girl.&nbsp; Captain Jolliffe
regarded the loose curls of their hair, their backs and
shoulders, down to their heels, for some time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who may them two maids be?&rsquo; he whispered to his
neighbour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The little one is Emily Hanning; the tall one Joanna
Phippard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I recollect &rsquo;em now, to be
sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He advanced to their elbow, and genially stole a gaze at
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily, you don&rsquo;t know me?&rsquo; said the sailor,
turning his beaming brown eyes on her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I do, Mr. Jolliffe,&rsquo; said Emily
shyly.</p>
<p>The other girl looked straight at him with her dark eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The face of Miss Joanna I don&rsquo;t call to mind so
well,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I know her beginnings
and kindred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They walked and talked together, Jolliffe narrating
particulars of his late narrow escape, till they reached the
corner of Sloop Lane, in which Emily Hanning dwelt, when, with a
nod and smile, she left them.&nbsp; Soon the sailor parted also
from Joanna, and, having no especial errand or appointment,
turned back towards Emily&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; She lived with her
father, who called himself an accountant, the daughter, however,
keeping a little stationery-shop as a supplemental provision for
the gaps of his somewhat uncertain business.&nbsp; On entering
Jolliffe found father and daughter about to begin tea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I didn&rsquo;t know it was tea-time,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, I&rsquo;ll have a cup with much
pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He remained to tea and long afterwards, telling more tales of
his seafaring life.&nbsp; Several neighbours called to listen,
and were asked to come in.&nbsp; Somehow Emily Hanning lost her
heart to the sailor that Sunday night, and in the course of a
week or two there was a tender understanding between them.</p>
<p>One moonlight evening in the next month Shadrach was ascending
out of the town by the long straight road eastward, to an
elevated suburb where the more fashionable houses stood&mdash;if
anything near this ancient port could be called
fashionable&mdash;when he saw a figure before him whom, from her
manner of glancing back, he took to be Emily.&nbsp; But, on
coming up, he found she was Joanna Phippard.&nbsp; He gave a
gallant greeting, and walked beside her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go along,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;or Emily will be
jealous!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He seemed not to like the suggestion, and remained.&nbsp; What
was said and what was done on that walk never could be clearly
recollected by Shadrach; but in some way or other Joanna
contrived to wean him away from her gentler and younger
rival.&nbsp; From that week onwards, Jolliffe was seen more and
more in the wake of Joanna Phippard and less in the company of
Emily; and it was soon rumoured about the quay that old
Jolliffe&rsquo;s son, who had come home from sea, was going to be
married to the former young woman, to the great disappointment of
the latter.</p>
<p>Just after this report had gone about, Joanna dressed herself
for a walk one morning, and started for Emily&rsquo;s house in
the little cross-street.&nbsp; Intelligence of the deep sorrow of
her friend on account of the loss of Shadrach had reached her
ears also, and her conscience reproached her for winning him
away.</p>
<p>Joanna was not altogether satisfied with the sailor.&nbsp; She
liked his attentions, and she coveted the dignity of matrimony;
but she had never been deeply in love with Jolliffe.&nbsp; For
one thing, she was ambitious, and socially his position was
hardly so good as her own, and there was always the chance of an
attractive woman mating considerably above her.&nbsp; It had long
been in her mind that she would not strongly object to give him
back again to Emily if her friend felt so very badly about
him.&nbsp; To this end she had written a letter of renunciation
to Shadrach, which letter she carried in her hand, intending to
send it if personal observation of Emily convinced her that her
friend was suffering.</p>
<p>Joanna entered Sloop Lane and stepped down into the
stationery-shop, which was below the pavement level.&nbsp;
Emily&rsquo;s father was never at home at this hour of the day,
and it seemed as though Emily were not at home either, for the
visitor could make nobody hear.&nbsp; Customers came so seldom
hither that a five minutes&rsquo; absence of the proprietor
counted for little.&nbsp; Joanna waited in the little shop, where
Emily had tastefully set out&mdash;as women can&mdash;articles in
themselves of slight value, so as to obscure the meagreness of
the stock-in-trade; till she saw a figure pausing without the
window apparently absorbed in the contemplation of the sixpenny
books, packets of paper, and prints hung on a string.&nbsp; It
was Captain Shadrach Jolliffe, peering in to ascertain if Emily
were there alone.&nbsp; Moved by an impulse of reluctance to meet
him in a spot which breathed of Emily, Joanna slipped through the
door that communicated with the parlour at the back.&nbsp; She
had frequently done so before, for in her friendship with Emily
she had the freedom of the house without ceremony.</p>
<p>Jolliffe entered the shop.&nbsp; Through the thin blind which
screened the glass partition she could see that he was
disappointed at not finding Emily there.&nbsp; He was about to go
out again, when Emily&rsquo;s form darkened the doorway,
hastening home from some errand.&nbsp; At sight of Jolliffe she
started back as if she would have gone out again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t run away, Emily; don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;What can make ye afraid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid, Captain Jolliffe.&nbsp;
Only&mdash;only I saw you all of a sudden, and&mdash;it made me
jump!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her voice showed that her heart had jumped
even more than the rest of her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I just called as I was passing,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For some paper?&rsquo;&nbsp; She hastened behind the
counter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, Emily; why do ye get behind there?&nbsp; Why
not stay by me?&nbsp; You seem to hate me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t hate you.&nbsp; How can I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then come out, so that we can talk like
Christians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emily obeyed with a fitful laugh, till she stood again beside
him in the open part of the shop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a dear,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say that, Captain Jolliffe; because
the words belong to somebody else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; I know what you mean.&nbsp; But, Emily, upon
my life I didn&rsquo;t know till this morning that you cared one
bit about me, or I should not have done as I have done.&nbsp; I
have the best of feelings for Joanna, but I know that from the
beginning she hasn&rsquo;t cared for me more than in a friendly
way; and I see now the one I ought to have asked to be my
wife.&nbsp; You know, Emily, when a man comes home from sea after
a long voyage he&rsquo;s as blind as a bat&mdash;he can&rsquo;t
see who&rsquo;s who in women.&nbsp; They are all alike to him,
beautiful creatures, and he takes the first that comes easy,
without thinking if she loves him, or if he might not soon love
another better than her.&nbsp; From the first I inclined to you
most, but you were so backward and shy that I thought you
didn&rsquo;t want me to bother &rsquo;ee, and so I went to
Joanna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more, Mr. Jolliffe,
don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said she, choking.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are going
to marry Joanna next month, and it is wrong
to&mdash;to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Emily, my darling!&rsquo; he cried, and clasped her
little figure in his arms before she was aware.</p>
<p>Joanna, behind the curtain, turned pale, tried to withdraw her
eyes, but could not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only you I love as a man ought to love the woman
he is going to marry; and I know this from what Joanna has said,
that she will willingly let me off!&nbsp; She wants to marry
higher I know, and only said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to me out of
kindness.&nbsp; A fine, tall girl like her isn&rsquo;t the sort
for a plain sailor&rsquo;s wife: you be the best suited for
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her and kissed her again, her flexible form
quivering in the agitation of his embrace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder&mdash;are you sure&mdash;Joanna is going to
break off with you?&nbsp; O, are you sure?&nbsp;
Because&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know she would not wish to make us miserable.&nbsp;
She will release me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I hope&mdash;I hope she will!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stay
any longer, Captain Jolliffe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He lingered, however, till a customer came for a penny stick
of sealing-wax, and then he withdrew.</p>
<p>Green envy had overspread Joanna at the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp; She
looked about for a way of escape.&nbsp; To get out without
Emily&rsquo;s knowledge of her visit was indispensable.&nbsp; She
crept from the parlour into the passage, and thence to the front
door of the house, where she let herself noiselessly into the
street.</p>
<p>The sight of that caress had reversed all her
resolutions.&nbsp; She could not let Shadrach go.&nbsp; Reaching
home she burnt the letter, and told her mother that if Captain
Jolliffe called she was too unwell to see him.</p>
<p>Shadrach, however, did not call.&nbsp; He sent her a note
expressing in simple language the state of his feelings; and
asked to be allowed to take advantage of the hints she had given
him that her affection, too, was little more than friendly, by
cancelling the engagement.</p>
<p>Looking out upon the harbour and the island beyond he waited
and waited in his lodgings for an answer that did not come.&nbsp;
The suspense grew to be so intolerable that after dark he went up
the High Street.&nbsp; He could not resist calling at
Joanna&rsquo;s to learn his fate.</p>
<p>Her mother said her daughter was too unwell to see him, and to
his questioning admitted that it was in consequence of a letter
received from himself; which had distressed her deeply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know what it was about, perhaps, Mrs.
Phippard?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Phippard owned that she did, adding that it put them in a
very painful position.&nbsp; Thereupon Shadrach, fearing that he
had been guilty of an enormity, explained that if his letter had
pained Joanna it must be owing to a misunderstanding, since he
had thought it would be a relief to her.&nbsp; If otherwise, he
would hold himself bound by his word, and she was to think of the
letter as never having been written.</p>
<p>Next morning he received an oral message from the young woman,
asking him to fetch her home from a meeting that evening.&nbsp;
This he did, and while walking from the Town Hall to her door,
with her hand in his arm, she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all the same as before between us, isn&rsquo;t
it, Shadrach?&nbsp; Your letter was sent in mistake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is all the same as before,&rsquo; he answered,
&lsquo;if you say it must be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish it to be,&rsquo; she murmured, with hard
lineaments, as she thought of Emily.</p>
<p>Shadrach was a religious and scrupulous man, who respected his
word as his life.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards the wedding took
place, Jolliffe having conveyed to Emily as gently as possible
the error he had fallen into when estimating Joanna&rsquo;s mood
as one of indifference.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>A month after the marriage Joanna&rsquo;s mother died, and the
couple were obliged to turn their attention to very practical
matters.&nbsp; Now that she was left without a parent, Joanna
could not bear the notion of her husband going to sea again, but
the question was, What could he do at home?&nbsp; They finally
decided to take on a grocer&rsquo;s shop in High Street, the
goodwill and stock of which were waiting to be disposed of at
that time.&nbsp; Shadrach knew nothing of shopkeeping, and Joanna
very little, but they hoped to learn.</p>
<p>To the management of this grocery business they now devoted
all their energies, and continued to conduct it for many
succeeding years, without great success.&nbsp; Two sons were born
to them, whom their mother loved to idolatry, although she had
never passionately loved her husband; and she lavished upon them
all her forethought and care.&nbsp; But the shop did not thrive,
and the large dreams she had entertained of her sons&rsquo;
education and career became attenuated in the face of
realities.&nbsp; Their schooling was of the plainest, but, being
by the sea, they grew alert in all such nautical arts and
enterprises as were attractive to their age.</p>
<p>The great interest of the Jolliffes&rsquo; married life,
outside their own immediate household, had lain in the marriage
of Emily.&nbsp; By one of those odd chances which lead those that
lurk in unexpected corners to be discovered, while the obvious
are passed by, the gentle girl had been seen and loved by a
thriving merchant of the town, a widower, some years older than
herself, though still in the prime of life.&nbsp; At first Emily
had declared that she never, never could marry any one; but Mr.
Lester had quietly persevered, and had at last won her reluctant
assent.&nbsp; Two children also were the fruits of this union,
and, as they grew and prospered, Emily declared that she had
never supposed that she could live to be so happy.</p>
<p>The worthy merchant&rsquo;s home, one of those large,
substantial brick mansions frequently jammed up in old-fashioned
towns, faced directly on the High Street, nearly opposite to the
grocery shop of the Jolliffes, and it now became the pain of
Joanna to behold the woman whose place she had usurped out of
pure covetousness, looking down from her position of comparative
wealth upon the humble shop-window with its dusty sugar-loaves,
heaps of raisins, and canisters of tea, over which it was her own
lot to preside.&nbsp; The business having so dwindled, Joanna was
obliged to serve in the shop herself; and it galled and mortified
her that Emily Lester, sitting in her large drawing-room over the
way, could witness her own dancings up and down behind the
counter at the beck and call of wretched twopenny customers,
whose patronage she was driven to welcome gladly: persons to whom
she was compelled to be civil in the street, while Emily was
bounding along with her children and her governess, and
conversing with the genteelest people of the town and
neighbourhood.&nbsp; This was what she had gained by not letting
Shadrach Jolliffe, whom she had so faintly loved, carry his
affection elsewhere.</p>
<p>Shadrach was a good and honest man, and he had been faithful
to her in heart and in deed.&nbsp; Time had clipped the wings of
his love for Emily in his devotion to the mother of his boys: he
had quite lived down that impulsive earlier fancy, and Emily had
become in his regard nothing more than a friend.&nbsp; It was the
same with Emily&rsquo;s feelings for him.&nbsp; Possibly, had she
found the least cause for jealousy, Joanna would almost have been
better satisfied.&nbsp; It was in the absolute acquiescence of
Emily and Shadrach in the results she herself had contrived that
her discontent found nourishment.</p>
<p>Shadrach was not endowed with the narrow shrewdness necessary
for developing a retail business in the face of many
competitors.&nbsp; Did a customer inquire if the grocer could
really recommend the wondrous substitute for eggs which a
persevering bagman had forced into his stock, he would answer
that &lsquo;when you did not put eggs into a pudding it was
difficult to taste them there&rsquo;; and when he was asked if
his &lsquo;real Mocha coffee&rsquo; was real Mocha, he would say
grimly, &lsquo;as understood in small shops.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One summer day, when the big brick house opposite was
reflecting the oppressive sun&rsquo;s heat into the shop, and
nobody was present but husband and wife, Joanna looked across at
Emily&rsquo;s door, where a wealthy visitor&rsquo;s carriage had
drawn up.&nbsp; Traces of patronage had been visible in
Emily&rsquo;s manner of late.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shadrach, the truth is, you are not a
business-man,&rsquo; his wife sadly murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
were not brought up to shopkeeping, and it is impossible for a
man to make a fortune at an occupation he has jumped into, as you
did into this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jolliffe agreed with her, in this as in everything else.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that I care a rope&rsquo;s end about making a
fortune,&rsquo; he said cheerfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am happy
enough, and we can rub on somehow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked again at the great house through the screen of
bottled pickles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rub on&mdash;yes,&rsquo; she said bitterly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But see how well off Emmy Lester is, who used to be so
poor!&nbsp; Her boys will go to College, no doubt; and think of
yours&mdash;obliged to go to the Parish School!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shadrach&rsquo;s thoughts had flown to Emily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody,&rsquo; he said good-humouredly, &lsquo;ever did
Emily a better turn than you did, Joanna, when you warned her off
me and put an end to that little simpering nonsense between us,
so as to leave it in her power to say &ldquo;Aye&rdquo; to Lester
when he came along.&rsquo;&nbsp; This almost maddened her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of bygones!&rsquo; she implored, in
stern sadness.&nbsp; &lsquo;But think, for the boys&rsquo; and my
sake, if not for your own, what are we to do to get
richer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, becoming serious, &lsquo;to tell
the truth, I have always felt myself unfit for this business,
though I&rsquo;ve never liked to say so.&nbsp; I seem to want
more room for sprawling; a more open space to strike out in than
here among friends and neighbours.&nbsp; I could get rich as well
as any man, if I tried my own way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would!&nbsp; What is your way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To go to sea again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had been the very one to keep him at home, hating the
semi-widowed existence of sailors&rsquo; wives.&nbsp; But her
ambition checked her instincts now, and she said: &lsquo;Do you
think success really lies that way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure it lies in no other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you want to go, Shadrach?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not for the pleasure of it, I can tell &rsquo;ee.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no such pleasure at sea, Joanna, as I can find in
my back parlour here.&nbsp; To speak honest, I have no love for
the brine.&nbsp; I never had much.&nbsp; But if it comes to a
question of a fortune for you and the lads, it is another
thing.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the only way to it for one born and
bred a seafarer as I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would it take long to earn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that depends; perhaps not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morning Shadrach pulled from a chest of drawers the
nautical jacket he had worn during the first months of his
return, brushed out the moths, donned it, and walked down to the
quay.&nbsp; The port still did a fair business in the
Newfoundland trade, though not so much as formerly.</p>
<p>It was not long after this that he invested all he possessed
in purchasing a part-ownership in a brig, of which he was
appointed captain.&nbsp; A few months were passed in
coast-trading, during which interval Shadrach wore off the
land-rust that had accumulated upon him in his grocery phase; and
in the spring the brig sailed for Newfoundland.</p>
<p>Joanna lived on at home with her sons, who were now growing up
into strong lads, and occupying themselves in various ways about
the harbour and quay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind, let them work a little,&rsquo; their fond
mother said to herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our necessities compel it
now, but when Shadrach comes home they will be only seventeen and
eighteen, and they shall be removed from the port, and their
education thoroughly taken in hand by a tutor; and with the money
they&rsquo;ll have they will perhaps be as near to gentlemen as
Emmy Lester&rsquo;s precious two, with their algebra and their
Latin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The date for Shadrach&rsquo;s return drew near and arrived,
and he did not appear.&nbsp; Joanna was assured that there was no
cause for anxiety, sailing-ships being so uncertain in their
coming; which assurance proved to be well grounded, for late one
wet evening, about a month after the calculated time, the ship
was announced as at hand, and presently the slip-slop step of
Shadrach as the sailor sounded in the passage, and he
entered.&nbsp; The boys had gone out and had missed him, and
Joanna was sitting alone.</p>
<p>As soon as the first emotion of reunion between the couple had
passed, Jolliffe explained the delay as owing to a small
speculative contract, which had produced good results.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was determined not to disappoint &rsquo;ee,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;and I think you&rsquo;ll own that I
haven&rsquo;t!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this he pulled out an enormous canvas bag, full and
rotund as the money-bag of the giant whom Jack slew, untied it,
and shook the contents out into her lap as she sat in her low
chair by the fire.&nbsp; A mass of sovereigns and guineas (there
were guineas on the earth in those days) fell into her lap with a
sudden thud, weighing down her gown to the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Shadrach complacently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I told &rsquo;ee, dear, I&rsquo;d do it; and have I done
it or no?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somehow her face, after the first excitement of possession,
did not retain its glory.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a lot of gold, indeed,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And&mdash;is this <i>all</i>?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All?&nbsp; Why, dear Joanna, do you know you can count
to three hundred in that heap?&nbsp; It is a fortune!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;yes.&nbsp; A fortune&mdash;judged by sea; but
judged by land&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, she banished considerations of the money for the
nonce.&nbsp; Soon the boys came in, and next Sunday Shadrach
returned thanks to God&mdash;this time by the more ordinary
channel of the italics in the General Thanksgiving.&nbsp; But a
few days after, when the question of investing the money arose,
he remarked that she did not seem so satisfied as he had
hoped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well you see, Shadrach,&rsquo; she answered,
&lsquo;<i>we</i> count by hundreds; <i>they</i> count by
thousands&rsquo; (nodding towards the other side of the
Street).&nbsp; &lsquo;They have set up a carriage and pair since
you left.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, have they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Shadrach, you don&rsquo;t know how the world
moves.&nbsp; However, we&rsquo;ll do the best we can with
it.&nbsp; But they are rich, and we are poor still!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The greater part of a year was desultorily spent.&nbsp; She
moved sadly about the house and shop, and the boys were still
occupying themselves in and around the harbour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joanna,&rsquo; he said, one day, &lsquo;I see by your
movements that it is not enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not enough,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;My boys
will have to live by steering the ships that the Lesters own; and
I was once above her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jolliffe was not an argumentative man, and he only murmured
that he thought he would make another voyage.</p>
<p>He meditated for several days, and coming home from the quay
one afternoon said suddenly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could do it for &rsquo;ee, dear, in one more trip,
for certain, if&mdash;if&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do what, Shadrach?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enable &rsquo;ee to count by thousands instead of
hundreds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I might take the boys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She turned pale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Shadrach,&rsquo; she answered
hastily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear it!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
danger at sea.&nbsp; I want them to be something genteel, and no
danger to them.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t let them risk their lives
at sea.&nbsp; O, I couldn&rsquo;t ever, ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, dear, it shan&rsquo;t be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day, after a silence, she asked a question:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If they were to go with you it would make a great deal
of difference, I suppose, to the profit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twould treble what I should get from the venture
single-handed.&nbsp; Under my eye they would be as good as two
more of myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Later on she said: &lsquo;Tell me more about this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the boys are almost as clever as master-mariners
in handling a craft, upon my life!&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t a more
cranky place in the Northern Seas than about the sandbanks of
this harbour, and they&rsquo;ve practised here from their
infancy.&nbsp; And they are so steady.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t get
their steadiness and their trustworthiness in half a dozen men
twice their age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is it <i>very</i> dangerous at sea; now, too, there
are rumours of war?&rsquo; she asked uneasily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, well, there be risks.&nbsp; Still . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>The idea grew and magnified, and the mother&rsquo;s heart was
crushed and stifled by it.&nbsp; Emmy was growing <i>too</i>
patronizing; it could not be borne.&nbsp; Shadrach&rsquo;s wife
could not help nagging him about their comparative poverty.&nbsp;
The young men, amiable as their father, when spoken to on the
subject of a voyage of enterprise, were quite willing to embark;
and though they, like their father, had no great love for the
sea, they became quite enthusiastic when the proposal was
detailed.</p>
<p>Everything now hung upon their mother&rsquo;s assent.&nbsp;
She withheld it long, but at last gave the word: the young men
might accompany their father.&nbsp; Shadrach was unusually
cheerful about it: Heaven had preserved him hitherto, and he had
uttered his thanks.&nbsp; God would not forsake those who were
faithful to him.</p>
<p>All that the Jolliffes possessed in the world was put into the
enterprise.&nbsp; The grocery stock was pared down to the least
that possibly could afford a bare sustenance to Joanna during the
absence, which was to last through the usual
&lsquo;New-f&rsquo;nland spell.&rsquo;&nbsp; How she would endure
the weary time she hardly knew, for the boys had been with her
formerly; but she nerved herself for the trial.</p>
<p>The ship was laden with boots and shoes, ready-made clothing,
fishing-tackle, butter, cheese, cordage, sailcloth, and many
other commodities; and was to bring back oil, furs, skins, fish,
cranberries, and what else came to hand.&nbsp; But much trading
to other ports was to be undertaken between the voyages out and
homeward, and thereby much money made.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>The brig sailed on a Monday morning in spring; but Joanna did
not witness its departure.&nbsp; She could not bear the sight
that she had been the means of bringing about.&nbsp; Knowing
this, her husband told her overnight that they were to sail some
time before noon next day hence when, awakening at five the next
morning, she heard them bustling about downstairs, she did not
hasten to descend, but lay trying to nerve herself for the
parting, imagining they would leave about nine, as her husband
had done on his previous voyage.&nbsp; When she did descend she
beheld words chalked upon the sloping face of the bureau; but no
husband or sons.&nbsp; In the hastily-scrawled lines Shadrach
said they had gone off thus not to pain her by a leave-taking;
and the sons had chalked under his words: &lsquo;Good-bye,
mother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She rushed to the quay, and looked down the harbour towards
the blue rim of the sea, but she could only see the masts and
bulging sails of the <i>Joanna</i>; no human figures.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis I have sent them!&rsquo; she said wildly, and
burst into tears.&nbsp; In the house the chalked
&lsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; nearly broke her heart.&nbsp; But when she
had re-entered the front room, and looked across at
Emily&rsquo;s, a gleam of triumph lit her thin face at her
anticipated release from the thraldom of subservience.</p>
<p>To do Emily Lester justice, her assumption of superiority was
mainly a figment of Joanna&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; That the
circumstances of the merchant&rsquo;s wife were more luxurious
than Joanna&rsquo;s, the former could not conceal; though
whenever the two met, which was not very often now, Emily
endeavoured to subdue the difference by every means in her
power.</p>
<p>The first summer lapsed away; and Joanna meagrely maintained
herself by the shop, which now consisted of little more than a
window and a counter.&nbsp; Emily was, in truth, her only large
customer; and Mrs. Lester&rsquo;s kindly readiness to buy
anything and everything without questioning the quality had a
sting of bitterness in it, for it was the uncritical attitude of
a patron, and almost of a donor.&nbsp; The long dreary winter
moved on; the face of the bureau had been turned to the wall to
protect the chalked words of farewell, for Joanna could never
bring herself to rub them out; and she often glanced at them with
wet eyes.&nbsp; Emily&rsquo;s handsome boys came home for the
Christmas holidays; the University was talked of for them; and
still Joanna subsisted as it were with held breath, like a person
submerged.&nbsp; Only one summer more, and the
&lsquo;spell&rsquo; would end.&nbsp; Towards the close of the
time Emily called on her quondam friend.&nbsp; She had heard that
Joanna began to feel anxious; she had received no letter from
husband or sons for some months.&nbsp; Emily&rsquo;s silks
rustled arrogantly when, in response to Joanna&rsquo;s almost
dumb invitation, she squeezed through the opening of the counter
and into the parlour behind the shop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>You</i> are all success, and <i>I</i> am all the
other way!&rsquo; said Joanna.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why do you think so?&rsquo; said Emily.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They are to bring back a fortune, I hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! will they come?&nbsp; The doubt is more than a
woman can bear.&nbsp; All three in one ship&mdash;think of
that!&nbsp; And I have not heard of them for months!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the time is not up.&nbsp; You should not meet
misfortune half-way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing will repay me for the grief of their
absence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why did you let them go?&nbsp; You were doing
fairly well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I made them go!&rsquo; she said, turning vehemently
upon Emily.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you why!&nbsp; I
could not bear that we should be only muddling on, and you so
rich and thriving!&nbsp; Now I have told you, and you may hate me
if you will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall never hate you, Joanna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And she proved the truth of her words afterwards.&nbsp; The
end of autumn came, and the brig should have been in port; but
nothing like the <i>Joanna</i> appeared in the channel between
the sands.&nbsp; It was now really time to be uneasy.&nbsp;
Joanna Jolliffe sat by the fire, and every gust of wind caused
her a cold thrill.&nbsp; She had always feared and detested the
sea; to her it was a treacherous, restless, slimy creature,
glorying in the griefs of women.&nbsp; &lsquo;Still,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;they <i>must</i> come!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She recalled to her mind that Shadrach had said before
starting that if they returned safe and sound, with success
crowning their enterprise, he would go as he had gone after his
shipwreck, and kneel with his sons in the church, and offer
sincere thanks for their deliverance.&nbsp; She went to church
regularly morning and afternoon, and sat in the most forward pew,
nearest the chancel-step.&nbsp; Her eyes were mostly fixed on
that step, where Shadrach had knelt in the bloom of his young
manhood: she knew to an inch the spot which his knees had pressed
twenty winters before; his outline as he had knelt, his hat on
the step beside him.&nbsp; God was good.&nbsp; Surely her husband
must kneel there again: a son on each side as he had said; George
just here, Jim just there.&nbsp; By long watching the spot as she
worshipped it became as if she saw the three returned ones there
kneeling; the two slim outlines of her boys, the more bulky form
between them; their hands clasped, their heads shaped against the
eastern wall.&nbsp; The fancy grew almost to an hallucination:
she could never turn her worn eyes to the step without seeing
them there.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they did not come.&nbsp; Heaven was merciful, but
it was not yet pleased to relieve her soul.&nbsp; This was her
purgation for the sin of making them the slaves of her
ambition.&nbsp; But it became more than purgation soon, and her
mood approached despair.&nbsp; Months had passed since the brig
had been due, but it had not returned.</p>
<p>Joanna was always hearing or seeing evidences of their
arrival.&nbsp; When on the hill behind the port, whence a view of
the open Channel could be obtained, she felt sure that a little
speck on the horizon, breaking the eternally level waste of
waters southward, was the truck of the <i>Joana&rsquo;s</i>
mainmast.&nbsp; Or when indoors, a shout or excitement of any
kind at the corner of the Town Cellar, where the High Street
joined the Quay, caused her to spring to her feet and cry:
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis they!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it was not.&nbsp; The visionary forms knelt every Sunday
afternoon on the chancel-step, but not the real.&nbsp; Her shop
had, as it were, eaten itself hollow.&nbsp; In the apathy which
had resulted from her loneliness and grief she had ceased to take
in the smallest supplies, and thus had sent away her last
customer.</p>
<p>In this strait Emily Lester tried by every means in her power
to aid the afflicted woman; but she met with constant
repulses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like you!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t bear to see
you!&rsquo; Joanna would whisper hoarsely when Emily came to her
and made advances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I want to help and soothe you, Joanna,&rsquo; Emily
would say.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a lady, with a rich husband and fine
sons!&nbsp; What can you want with a bereaved crone like
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joanna, I want this: I want you to come and live in my
house, and not stay alone in this dismal place any
longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And suppose they come and don&rsquo;t find me at
home?&nbsp; You wish to separate me and mine!&nbsp; No,
I&rsquo;ll stay here.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like you, and I
can&rsquo;t thank you, whatever kindness you do me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, as time went on Joanna could not afford to pay the
rent of the shop and house without an income.&nbsp; She was
assured that all hope of the return of Shadrach and his sons was
vain, and she reluctantly consented to accept the asylum of the
Lesters&rsquo; house.&nbsp; Here she was allotted a room of her
own on the second floor, and went and came as she chose, without
contact with the family.&nbsp; Her hair greyed and whitened, deep
lines channeled her forehead, and her form grew gaunt and
stooping.&nbsp; But she still expected the lost ones, and when
she met Emily on the staircase she would say morosely: &lsquo;I
know why you&rsquo;ve got me here!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll come, and
be disappointed at not finding me at home, and perhaps go away
again; and then you&rsquo;ll be revenged for my taking Shadrach
away from &rsquo;ee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emily Lester bore these reproaches from the grief-stricken
soul.&nbsp; She was sure&mdash;all the people of Havenpool were
sure&mdash;that Shadrach and his sons could not return.&nbsp; For
years the vessel had been given up as lost.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when awakened at night by any noise, Joanna
would rise from bed and glance at the shop opposite by the light
from the flickering lamp, to make sure it was not they.</p>
<p>It was a damp and dark December night, six years after the
departure of the brig <i>Joanna</i>.&nbsp; The wind was from the
sea, and brought up a fishy mist which mopped the face like moist
flannel.&nbsp; Joanna had prayed her usual prayer for the absent
ones with more fervour and confidence than she had felt for
months, and had fallen asleep about eleven.&nbsp; It must have
been between one and two when she suddenly started up.&nbsp; She
had certainly heard steps in the street, and the voices of
Shadrach and her sons calling at the door of the grocery
shop.&nbsp; She sprang out of bed, and, hardly knowing what
clothing she dragged on herself; hastened down Emily&rsquo;s
large and carpeted staircase, put the candle on the hall-table,
unfastened the bolts and chain, and stepped into the
street.&nbsp; The mist, blowing up the street from the Quay,
hindered her seeing the shop, although it was so near; but she
had crossed to it in a moment.&nbsp; How was it?&nbsp; Nobody
stood there.&nbsp; The wretched woman walked wildly up and down
with her bare feet&mdash;there was not a soul.&nbsp; She returned
and knocked with all her might at the door which had once been
her own&mdash;they might have been admitted for the night,
unwilling to disturb her till the morning.</p>
<p>It was not till several minutes had elapsed that the young man
who now kept the shop looked out of an upper window, and saw the
skeleton of something human standing below half-dressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has anybody come?&rsquo; asked the form.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Mrs. Jolliffe, I didn&rsquo;t know it was
you,&rsquo; said the young man kindly, for he was aware how her
baseless expectations moved her.&nbsp; &lsquo;No; nobody has
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>June</i> 1891.</p>
<h2>THE MELANCHOLY HUSSAR OF THE GERMAN LEGION</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p>Here stretch the downs, high and breezy and green, absolutely
unchanged since those eventful days.&nbsp; A plough has never
disturbed the turf, and the sod that was uppermost then is
uppermost now.&nbsp; Here stood the camp; here are distinct
traces of the banks thrown up for the horses of the cavalry, and
spots where the midden-heaps lay are still to be observed.&nbsp;
At night, when I walk across the lonely place, it is impossible
to avoid hearing, amid the scourings of the wind over the
grass-bents and thistles, the old trumpet and bugle calls, the
rattle of the halters; to help seeing rows of spectral tents and
the <i>impedimenta</i> of the soldiery.&nbsp; From within the
canvases come guttural syllables of foreign tongues, and broken
songs of the fatherland; for they were mainly regiments of the
King&rsquo;s German Legion that slept round the tent-poles
hereabout at that time.</p>
<p>It was nearly ninety years ago.&nbsp; The British uniform of
the period, with its immense epaulettes, queer cocked-hat,
breeches, gaiters, ponderous cartridge-box, buckled shoes, and
what not, would look strange and barbarous now.&nbsp; Ideas have
changed; invention has followed invention.&nbsp; Soldiers were
monumental objects then.&nbsp; A divinity still hedged kings here
and there; and war was considered a glorious thing.</p>
<p>Secluded old manor-houses and hamlets lie in the ravines and
hollows among these hills, where a stranger had hardly ever been
seen till the King chose to take the baths yearly at the sea-side
watering-place a few miles to the south; as a consequence of
which battalions descended in a cloud upon the open country
around.&nbsp; Is it necessary to add that the echoes of many
characteristic tales, dating from that picturesque time, still
linger about here in more or less fragmentary form, to be caught
by the attentive ear?&nbsp; Some of them I have repeated; most of
them I have forgotten; one I have never repeated, and assuredly
can never forget.</p>
<p>Phyllis told me the story with her own lips.&nbsp; She was
then an old lady of seventy-five, and her auditor a lad of
fifteen.&nbsp; She enjoined silence as to her share in the
incident, till she should be &lsquo;dead, buried, and
forgotten.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her life was prolonged twelve years after
the day of her narration, and she has now been dead nearly
twenty.&nbsp; The oblivion which in her modesty and humility she
courted for herself has only partially fallen on her, with the
unfortunate result of inflicting an injustice upon her memory;
since such fragments of her story as got abroad at the time, and
have been kept alive ever since, are precisely those which are
most unfavourable to her character.</p>
<p>It all began with the arrival of the York Hussars, one of the
foreign regiments above alluded to.&nbsp; Before that day
scarcely a soul had been seen near her father&rsquo;s house for
weeks.&nbsp; When a noise like the brushing skirt of a visitor
was heard on the doorstep, it proved to be a scudding leaf; when
a carriage seemed to be nearing the door, it was her father
grinding his sickle on the stone in the garden for his favourite
relaxation of trimming the box-tree borders to the plots.&nbsp; A
sound like luggage thrown down from the coach was a gun far away
at sea; and what looked like a tall man by the gate at dusk was a
yew bush cut into a quaint and attenuated shape.&nbsp; There is
no such solitude in country places now as there was in those old
days.</p>
<p>Yet all the while King George and his court were at his
favourite sea-side resort, not more than five miles off.</p>
<p>The daughter&rsquo;s seclusion was great, but beyond the
seclusion of the girl lay the seclusion of the father.&nbsp; If
her social condition was twilight, his was darkness.&nbsp; Yet he
enjoyed his darkness, while her twilight oppressed her.&nbsp; Dr.
Grove had been a professional man whose taste for lonely
meditation over metaphysical questions had diminished his
practice till it no longer paid him to keep it going; after which
he had relinquished it and hired at a nominal rent the small,
dilapidated, half farm half manor-house of this obscure inland
nook, to make a sufficiency of an income which in a town would
have been inadequate for their maintenance.&nbsp; He stayed in
his garden the greater part of the day, growing more and more
irritable with the lapse of time, and the increasing perception
that he had wasted his life in the pursuit of illusions.&nbsp; He
saw his friends less and less frequently.&nbsp; Phyllis became so
shy that if she met a stranger anywhere in her short rambles she
felt ashamed at his gaze, walked awkwardly, and blushed to her
shoulders.</p>
<p>Yet Phyllis was discovered even here by an admirer, and her
hand most unexpectedly asked in marriage.</p>
<p>The King, as aforesaid, was at the neighbouring town, where he
had taken up his abode at Gloucester Lodge and his presence in
the town naturally brought many county people thither.&nbsp;
Among these idlers&mdash;many of whom professed to have
connections and interests with the Court&mdash;was one Humphrey
Gould, a bachelor; a personage neither young nor old; neither
good-looking nor positively plain.&nbsp; Too steady-going to be
&lsquo;a buck&rsquo; (as fast and unmarried men were then
called), he was an approximately fashionable man of a mild
type.&nbsp; This bachelor of thirty found his way to the village
on the down: beheld Phyllis; made her father&rsquo;s acquaintance
in order to make hers; and by some means or other she
sufficiently inflamed his heart to lead him in that direction
almost daily; till he became engaged to marry her.</p>
<p>As he was of an old local family, some of whose members were
held in respect in the county, Phyllis, in bringing him to her
feet, had accomplished what was considered a brilliant move for
one in her constrained position.&nbsp; How she had done it was
not quite known to Phyllis herself.&nbsp; In those days unequal
marriages were regarded rather as a violation of the laws of
nature than as a mere infringement of convention, the more modern
view, and hence when Phyllis, of the watering-place bourgeoisie,
was chosen by such a gentlemanly fellow, it was as if she were
going to be taken to heaven, though perhaps the uninformed would
have seen no great difference in the respective positions of the
pair, the said Gould being as poor as a crow.</p>
<p>This pecuniary condition was his excuse&mdash;probably a true
one&mdash;for postponing their union, and as the winter drew
nearer, and the King departed for the season, Mr. Humphrey Gould
set out for Bath, promising to return to Phyllis in a few
weeks.&nbsp; The winter arrived, the date of his promise passed,
yet Gould postponed his coming, on the ground that he could not
very easily leave his father in the city of their sojourn, the
elder having no other relative near him.&nbsp; Phyllis, though
lonely in the extreme, was content.&nbsp; The man who had asked
her in marriage was a desirable husband for her in many ways; her
father highly approved of his suit; but this neglect of her was
awkward, if not painful, for Phyllis.&nbsp; Love him in the true
sense of the word she assured me she never did, but she had a
genuine regard for him; admired a certain methodical and dogged
way in which he sometimes took his pleasure; valued his knowledge
of what the Court was doing, had done, or was about to do; and
she was not without a feeling of pride that he had chosen her
when he might have exercised a more ambitious choice.</p>
<p>But he did not come; and the spring developed.&nbsp; His
letters were regular though formal; and it is not to be wondered
that the uncertainty of her position, linked with the fact that
there was not much passion in her thoughts of Humphrey, bred an
indescribable dreariness in the heart of Phyllis Grove.&nbsp; The
spring was soon summer, and the summer brought the King; but
still no Humphrey Gould.&nbsp; All this while the engagement by
letter was maintained intact.</p>
<p>At this point of time a golden radiance flashed in upon the
lives of people here, and charged all youthful thought with
emotional interest.&nbsp; This radiance was the aforesaid York
Hussars.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>The present generation has probably but a very dim notion of
the celebrated York Hussars of ninety years ago.&nbsp; They were
one of the regiments of the King&rsquo;s German Legion, and
(though they somewhat degenerated later on) their brilliant
uniform, their splendid horses, and above all, their foreign air
and mustachios (rare appendages then), drew crowds of admirers of
both sexes wherever they went.&nbsp; These with other regiments
had come to encamp on the downs and pastures, because of the
presence of the King in the neighbouring town.</p>
<p>The spot was high and airy, and the view extensive, commanding
the Isle of Portland in front, and reaching to St.
Aldhelm&rsquo;s Head eastward, and almost to the Start on the
west.</p>
<p>Phyllis, though not precisely a girl of the village, was as
interested as any of them in this military investment.&nbsp; Her
father&rsquo;s home stood somewhat apart, and on the highest
point of ground to which the lane ascended, so that it was almost
level with the top of the church tower in the lower part of the
parish.&nbsp; Immediately from the outside of the garden-wall the
grass spread away to a great distance, and it was crossed by a
path which came close to the wall.&nbsp; Ever since her childhood
it had been Phyllis&rsquo;s pleasure to clamber up this fence and
sit on the top&mdash;a feat not so difficult as it may seem, the
walls in this district being built of rubble, without mortar, so
that there were plenty of crevices for small toes.</p>
<p>She was sitting up here one day, listlessly surveying the
pasture without, when her attention was arrested by a solitary
figure walking along the path.&nbsp; It was one of the renowned
German Hussars, and he moved onward with his eyes on the ground,
and with the manner of one who wished to escape company.&nbsp;
His head would probably have been bent like his eyes but for his
stiff neck-gear.&nbsp; On nearer view she perceived that his face
was marked with deep sadness.&nbsp; Without observing her, he
advanced by the footpath till it brought him almost immediately
under the wall.</p>
<p>Phyllis was much surprised to see a fine, tall soldier in such
a mood as this.&nbsp; Her theory of the military, and of the York
Hussars in particular (derived entirely from hearsay, for she had
never talked to a soldier in her life), was that their hearts
were as gay as their accoutrements.</p>
<p>At this moment the Hussar lifted his eyes and noticed her on
her perch, the white muslin neckerchief which covered her
shoulders and neck where left bare by her low gown, and her white
raiment in general, showing conspicuously in the bright sunlight
of this summer day.&nbsp; He blushed a little at the suddenness
of the encounter, and without halting a moment from his pace
passed on.</p>
<p>All that day the foreigner&rsquo;s face haunted Phyllis; its
aspect was so striking, so handsome, and his eyes were so blue,
and sad, and abstracted.&nbsp; It was perhaps only natural that
on some following day at the same hour she should look over that
wall again, and wait till he had passed a second time.&nbsp; On
this occasion he was reading a letter, and at the sight of her
his manner was that of one who had half expected or hoped to
discover her.&nbsp; He almost stopped, smiled, and made a
courteous salute.&nbsp; The end of the meeting was that they
exchanged a few words.&nbsp; She asked him what he was reading,
and he readily informed her that he was re-perusing letters from
his mother in Germany; he did not get them often, he said, and
was forced to read the old ones a great many times.&nbsp; This
was all that passed at the present interview, but others of the
same kind followed.</p>
<p>Phyllis used to say that his English, though not good, was
quite intelligible to her, so that their acquaintance was never
hindered by difficulties of speech.&nbsp; Whenever the subject
became too delicate, subtle, or tender, for such words of English
as were at his command, the eyes no doubt helped out the tongue,
and&mdash;though this was later on&mdash;the lips helped out the
eyes.&nbsp; In short this acquaintance, unguardedly made, and
rash enough on her part, developed and ripened.&nbsp; Like
Desdemona, she pitied him, and learnt his history.</p>
<p>His name was Matth&auml;us Tina, and Saarbr&uuml;ck his native
town, where his mother was still living.&nbsp; His age was
twenty-two, and he had already risen to the grade of corporal,
though he had not long been in the army.&nbsp; Phyllis used to
assert that no such refined or well-educated young man could have
been found in the ranks of the purely English regiments, some of
these foreign soldiers having rather the graceful manner and
presence of our native officers than of our rank and file.</p>
<p>She by degrees learnt from her foreign friend a circumstance
about himself and his comrades which Phyllis would least have
expected of the York Hussars.&nbsp; So far from being as gay as
its uniform, the regiment was pervaded by a dreadful melancholy,
a chronic home-sickness, which depressed many of the men to such
an extent that they could hardly attend to their drill.&nbsp; The
worst sufferers were the younger soldiers who had not been over
here long.&nbsp; They hated England and English life; they took
no interest whatever in King George and his island kingdom, and
they only wished to be out of it and never to see it any
more.&nbsp; Their bodies were here, but their hearts and minds
were always far away in their dear fatherland, of
which&mdash;brave men and stoical as they were in many
ways&mdash;they would speak with tears in their eyes.&nbsp; One
of the worst of the sufferers from this home-woe, as he called it
in his own tongue, was Matth&auml;us Tina, whose dreamy musing
nature felt the gloom of exile still more intensely from the fact
that he had left a lonely mother at home with nobody to cheer
her.</p>
<p>Though Phyllis, touched by all this, and interested in his
history, did not disdain her soldier&rsquo;s acquaintance, she
declined (according to her own account, at least) to permit the
young man to overstep the line of mere friendship for a long
while&mdash;as long, indeed, as she considered herself likely to
become the possession of another; though it is probable that she
had lost her heart to Matth&auml;us before she was herself
aware.&nbsp; The stone wall of necessity made anything like
intimacy difficult; and he had never ventured to come, or to ask
to come, inside the garden, so that all their conversation had
been overtly conducted across this boundary.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p>But news reached the village from a friend of Phyllis&rsquo;s
father concerning Mr. Humphrey Gould, her remarkably cool and
patient betrothed.&nbsp; This gentleman had been heard to say in
Bath that he considered his overtures to Miss Phyllis Grove to
have reached only the stage of a half-understanding; and in view
of his enforced absence on his father&rsquo;s account, who was
too great an invalid now to attend to his affairs, he thought it
best that there should be no definite promise as yet on either
side.&nbsp; He was not sure, indeed, that he might not cast his
eyes elsewhere.</p>
<p>This account&mdash;though only a piece of hearsay, and as such
entitled to no absolute credit&mdash;tallied so well with the
infrequency of his letters and their lack of warmth, that Phyllis
did not doubt its truth for one moment; and from that hour she
felt herself free to bestow her heart as she should choose.&nbsp;
Not so her father; he declared the whole story to be a
fabrication.&nbsp; He had known Mr. Gould&rsquo;s family from his
boyhood; and if there was one proverb which expressed the
matrimonial aspect of that family well, it was &lsquo;Love me
little, love me long.&rsquo;&nbsp; Humphrey was an honourable
man, who would not think of treating his engagement so
lightly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you wait in patience,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;all will be right enough in time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From these words Phyllis at first imagined that her father was
in correspondence with Mr. Gould; and her heart sank within her;
for in spite of her original intentions she had been relieved to
hear that her engagement had come to nothing.&nbsp; But she
presently learnt that her father had heard no more of Humphrey
Gould than she herself had done; while he would not write and
address her affianced directly on the subject, lest it should be
deemed an imputation on that bachelor&rsquo;s honour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You want an excuse for encouraging one or other of
those foreign fellows to flatter you with his unmeaning
attentions,&rsquo; her father exclaimed, his mood having of late
been a very unkind one towards her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I see more than
I say.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you ever set foot outside that
garden-fence without my permission.&nbsp; If you want to see the
camp I&rsquo;ll take you myself some Sunday afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phyllis had not the smallest intention of disobeying him in
her actions, but she assumed herself to be independent with
respect to her feelings.&nbsp; She no longer checked her fancy
for the Hussar, though she was far from regarding him as her
lover in the serious sense in which an Englishman might have been
regarded as such.&nbsp; The young foreign soldier was almost an
ideal being to her, with none of the appurtenances of an ordinary
house-dweller; one who had descended she knew not whence, and
would disappear she knew not whither; the subject of a
fascinating dream&mdash;no more.</p>
<p>They met continually now&mdash;mostly at dusk&mdash;during the
brief interval between the going down of the sun and the minute
at which the last trumpet-call summoned him to his tent.&nbsp;
Perhaps her manner had become less restrained latterly; at any
rate that of the Hussar was so; he had grown more tender every
day, and at parting after these hurried interviews she reached
down her hand from the top of the wall that he might press
it.&nbsp; One evening he held it so long that she exclaimed,
&lsquo;The wall is white, and somebody in the field may see your
shape against it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He lingered so long that night that it was with the greatest
difficulty that he could run across the intervening stretch of
ground and enter the camp in time.&nbsp; On the next occasion of
his awaiting her she did not appear in her usual place at the
usual hour.&nbsp; His disappointment was unspeakably keen; he
remained staring blankly at the spot, like a man in a
trance.&nbsp; The trumpets and tattoo sounded, and still he did
not go.</p>
<p>She had been delayed purely by an accident.&nbsp; When she
arrived she was anxious because of the lateness of the hour,
having heard as well as he the sounds denoting the closing of the
camp.&nbsp; She implored him to leave immediately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said gloomily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall not
go in yet&mdash;the moment you come&mdash;I have thought of your
coming all day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you may be disgraced at being after
time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that.&nbsp; I should have
disappeared from the world some time ago if it had not been for
two persons&mdash;my beloved, here, and my mother in
Saarbr&uuml;ck.&nbsp; I hate the army.&nbsp; I care more for a
minute of your company than for all the promotion in the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus he stayed and talked to her, and told her interesting
details of his native place, and incidents of his childhood, till
she was in a simmer of distress at his recklessness in
remaining.&nbsp; It was only because she insisted on bidding him
good-night and leaving the wall that he returned to his
quarters.</p>
<p>The next time that she saw him he was without the stripes that
had adorned his sleeve.&nbsp; He had been broken to the level of
private for his lateness that night; and as Phyllis considered
herself to be the cause of his disgrace her sorrow was
great.&nbsp; But the position was now reversed; it was his turn
to cheer her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t grieve, meine Liebliche!&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have got a remedy for whatever comes.&nbsp;
First, even supposing I regain my stripes, would your father
allow you to marry a non-commissioned officer in the York
Hussars?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She flushed.&nbsp; This practical step had not been in her
mind in relation to such an unrealistic person as he was; and a
moment&rsquo;s reflection was enough for it.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
father would not&mdash;certainly would not,&rsquo; she answered
unflinchingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It cannot be thought of!&nbsp; My
dear friend, please do forget me: I fear I am ruining you and
your prospects!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are giving
this country of yours just sufficient interest to me to make me
care to keep alive in it.&nbsp; If my dear land were here also,
and my old parent, with you, I could be happy as I am, and would
do my best as a soldier.&nbsp; But it is not so.&nbsp; And now
listen.&nbsp; This is my plan.&nbsp; That you go with me to my
own country, and be my wife there, and live there with my mother
and me.&nbsp; I am not a Hanoverian, as you know, though I
entered the army as such; my country is by the Saar, and is at
peace with France, and if I were once in it I should be
free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how get there?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; Phyllis had
been rather amazed than shocked at his proposition.&nbsp; Her
position in her father&rsquo;s house was growing irksome and
painful in the extreme; his parental affection seemed to be quite
dried up.&nbsp; She was not a native of the village, like all the
joyous girls around her; and in some way Matth&auml;us Tina had
infected her with his own passionate longing for his country, and
mother, and home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how?&rsquo; she repeated, finding that he did not
answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you buy your discharge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, no,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
impossible in these times.&nbsp; No; I came here against my will;
why should I not escape?&nbsp; Now is the time, as we shall soon
be striking camp, and I might see you no more.&nbsp; This is my
scheme.&nbsp; I will ask you to meet me on the highway two miles
off; on some calm night next week that may be appointed.&nbsp;
There will be nothing unbecoming in it, or to cause you shame;
you will not fly alone with me, for I will bring with me my
devoted young friend Christoph, an Alsatian, who has lately
joined the regiment, and who has agreed to assist in this
enterprise.&nbsp; We shall have come from yonder harbour, where
we shall have examined the boats, and found one suited to our
purpose.&nbsp; Christoph has already a chart of the Channel, and
we will then go to the harbour, and at midnight cut the boat from
her moorings, and row away round the point out of sight; and by
the next morning we are on the coast of France, near
Cherbourg.&nbsp; The rest is easy, for I have saved money for the
land journey, and can get a change of clothes.&nbsp; I will write
to my mother, who will meet us on the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added details in reply to her inquiries, which left no
doubt in Phyllis&rsquo;s mind of the feasibility of the
undertaking.&nbsp; But its magnitude almost appalled her; and it
is questionable if she would ever have gone further in the wild
adventure if, on entering the house that night, her father had
not accosted her in the most significant terms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How about the York Hussars?&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are still at the camp; but they are soon going
away, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is useless for you to attempt to cloak your actions
in that way.&nbsp; You have been meeting one of those fellows;
you have been seen walking with him&mdash;foreign barbarians, not
much better than the French themselves!&nbsp; I have made up my
mind&mdash;don&rsquo;t speak a word till I have done,
please!&mdash;I have made up my mind that you shall stay here no
longer while they are on the spot.&nbsp; You shall go to your
aunt&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was useless for her to protest that she had never taken a
walk with any soldier or man under the sun except himself.&nbsp;
Her protestations were feeble, too, for though he was not
literally correct in his assertion, he was virtually only half in
error.</p>
<p>The house of her father&rsquo;s sister was a prison to
Phyllis.&nbsp; She had quite recently undergone experience of its
gloom; and when her father went on to direct her to pack what
would be necessary for her to take, her heart died within
her.&nbsp; In after years she never attempted to excuse her
conduct during this week of agitation; but the result of her
self-communing was that she decided to join in the scheme of her
lover and his friend, and fly to the country which he had
coloured with such lovely hues in her imagination.&nbsp; She
always said that the one feature in his proposal which overcame
her hesitation was the obvious purity and straightforwardness of
his intentions.&nbsp; He showed himself to be so virtuous and
kind; he treated her with a respect to which she had never before
been accustomed; and she was braced to the obvious risks of the
voyage by her confidence in him.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p>It was on a soft, dark evening of the following week that they
engaged in the adventure.&nbsp; Tina was to meet her at a point
in the highway at which the lane to the village branched
off.&nbsp; Christoph was to go ahead of them to the harbour where
the boat lay, row it round the Nothe&mdash;or Look-out as it was
called in those days&mdash;and pick them up on the other side of
the promontory, which they were to reach by crossing the
harbour-bridge on foot, and climbing over the Look-out hill.</p>
<p>As soon as her father had ascended to his room she left the
house, and, bundle in hand, proceeded at a trot along the
lane.&nbsp; At such an hour not a soul was afoot anywhere in the
village, and she reached the junction of the lane with the
highway unobserved.&nbsp; Here she took up her position in the
obscurity formed by the angle of a fence, whence she could
discern every one who approached along the turnpike-road, without
being herself seen.</p>
<p>She had not remained thus waiting for her lover longer than a
minute&mdash;though from the tension of her nerves the lapse of
even that short time was trying&mdash;when, instead of the
expected footsteps, the stage-coach could be heard descending the
hill.&nbsp; She knew that Tina would not show himself till the
road was clear, and waited impatiently for the coach to
pass.&nbsp; Nearing the corner where she was it slackened speed,
and, instead of going by as usual, drew up within a few yards of
her.&nbsp; A passenger alighted, and she heard his voice.&nbsp;
It was Humphrey Gould&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He had brought a friend with him, and luggage.&nbsp; The
luggage was deposited on the grass, and the coach went on its
route to the royal watering-place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder where that young man is with the horse and
trap?&rsquo; said her former admirer to his companion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I hope we shan&rsquo;t have to wait here long.&nbsp; I
told him half-past nine o&rsquo;clock precisely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you got her present safe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phyllis&rsquo;s?&nbsp; O, yes.&nbsp; It is in this
trunk.&nbsp; I hope it will please her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it will.&nbsp; What woman would not be
pleased with such a handsome peace-offering?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;she deserves it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve treated
her rather badly.&nbsp; But she has been in my mind these last
two days much more than I should care to confess to
everybody.&nbsp; Ah, well; I&rsquo;ll say no more about
that.&nbsp; It cannot be that she is so bad as they make
out.&nbsp; I am quite sure that a girl of her good wit would know
better than to get entangled with any of those Hanoverian
soldiers.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t believe it of her, and
there&rsquo;s an end on&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More words in the same strain were casually dropped as the two
men waited; words which revealed to her, as by a sudden
illumination, the enormity of her conduct.&nbsp; The conversation
was at length cut off by the arrival of the man with the
vehicle.&nbsp; The luggage was placed in it, and they mounted,
and were driven on in the direction from which she had just
come.</p>
<p>Phyllis was so conscience-stricken that she was at first
inclined to follow them; but a moment&rsquo;s reflection led her
to feel that it would only be bare justice to Matth&auml;us to
wait till he arrived, and explain candidly that she had changed
her mind&mdash;difficult as the struggle would be when she stood
face to face with him.&nbsp; She bitterly reproached herself for
having believed reports which represented Humphrey Gould as false
to his engagement, when, from what she now heard from his own
lips, she gathered that he had been living full of trust in
her.&nbsp; But she knew well enough who had won her love.&nbsp;
Without him her life seemed a dreary prospect, yet the more she
looked at his proposal the more she feared to accept it&mdash;so
wild as it was, so vague, so venturesome.&nbsp; She had promised
Humphrey Gould, and it was only his assumed faithlessness which
had led her to treat that promise as nought.&nbsp; His solicitude
in bringing her these gifts touched her; her promise must be
kept, and esteem must take the place of love.&nbsp; She would
preserve her self-respect.&nbsp; She would stay at home, and
marry him, and suffer.</p>
<p>Phyllis had thus braced herself to an exceptional fortitude
when, a few minutes later, the outline of Matth&auml;us Tina
appeared behind a field-gate, over which he lightly leapt as she
stepped forward.&nbsp; There was no evading it, he pressed her to
his breast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the first and last time!&rsquo; she wildly
thought as she stood encircled by his arms.</p>
<p>How Phyllis got through the terrible ordeal of that night she
could never clearly recollect.&nbsp; She always attributed her
success in carrying out her resolve to her lover&rsquo;s honour,
for as soon as she declared to him in feeble words that she had
changed her mind, and felt that she could not, dared not, fly
with him, he forbore to urge her, grieved as he was at her
decision.&nbsp; Unscrupulous pressure on his part, seeing how
romantically she had become attached to him, would no doubt have
turned the balance in his favour.&nbsp; But he did nothing to
tempt her unduly or unfairly.</p>
<p>On her side, fearing for his safety, she begged him to
remain.&nbsp; This, he declared, could not be.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
cannot break faith with my friend,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; Had he
stood alone he would have abandoned his plan.&nbsp; But
Christoph, with the boat and compass and chart, was waiting on
the shore; the tide would soon turn; his mother had been warned
of his coming; go he must.</p>
<p>Many precious minutes were lost while he tarried, unable to
tear himself away.&nbsp; Phyllis held to her resolve, though it
cost her many a bitter pang.&nbsp; At last they parted, and he
went down the hill.&nbsp; Before his footsteps had quite died
away she felt a desire to behold at least his outline once more,
and running noiselessly after him regained view of his
diminishing figure.&nbsp; For one moment she was sufficiently
excited to be on the point of rushing forward and linking her
fate with his.&nbsp; But she could not.&nbsp; The courage which
at the critical instant failed Cleopatra of Egypt could scarcely
be expected of Phyllis Grove.</p>
<p>A dark shape, similar to his own, joined him in the
highway.&nbsp; It was Christoph, his friend.&nbsp; She could see
no more; they had hastened on in the direction of the town and
harbour, four miles ahead.&nbsp; With a feeling akin to despair
she turned and slowly pursued her way homeward.</p>
<p>Tattoo sounded in the camp; but there was no camp for her
now.&nbsp; It was as dead as the camp of the Assyrians after the
passage of the Destroying Angel.</p>
<p>She noiselessly entered the house, seeing nobody, and went to
bed.&nbsp; Grief, which kept her awake at first, ultimately
wrapped her in a heavy sleep.&nbsp; The next morning her father
met her at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gould is come!&rsquo; he said triumphantly.</p>
<p>Humphrey was staying at the inn, and had already called to
inquire for her.&nbsp; He had brought her a present of a very
handsome looking-glass in a frame of <i>repouss&eacute;</i>
silverwork, which her father held in his hand.&nbsp; He had
promised to call again in the course of an hour, to ask Phyllis
to walk with him.</p>
<p>Pretty mirrors were rarer in country-houses at that day than
they are now, and the one before her won Phyllis&rsquo;s
admiration.&nbsp; She looked into it, saw how heavy her eyes
were, and endeavoured to brighten them.&nbsp; She was in that
wretched state of mind which leads a woman to move mechanically
onward in what she conceives to be her allotted path.&nbsp; Mr.
Humphrey had, in his undemonstrative way, been adhering all along
to the old understanding; it was for her to do the same, and to
say not a word of her own lapse.&nbsp; She put on her bonnet and
tippet, and when he arrived at the hour named she was at the door
awaiting him.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>Phyllis thanked him for his beautiful gift; but the talking
was soon entirely on Humphrey&rsquo;s side as they walked
along.&nbsp; He told her of the latest movements of the world of
fashion&mdash;a subject which she willingly discussed to the
exclusion of anything more personal&mdash;and his measured
language helped to still her disquieted heart and brain.&nbsp;
Had not her own sadness been what it was she must have observed
his embarrassment.&nbsp; At last he abruptly changed the
subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you are pleased with my little
present,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;The truth is that I brought
it to propitiate &rsquo;ee, and to get you to help me out of a
mighty difficulty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was inconceivable to Phyllis that this independent
bachelor&mdash;whom she admired in some respects&mdash;could have
a difficulty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phyllis&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you my secret at once;
for I have a monstrous secret to confide before I can ask your
counsel.&nbsp; The case is, then, that I am married: yes, I have
privately married a dear young belle; and if you knew her, and I
hope you will, you would say everything in her praise.&nbsp; But
she is not quite the one that my father would have chose for
me&mdash;you know the paternal idea as well as I&mdash;and I have
kept it secret.&nbsp; There will be a terrible noise, no doubt;
but I think that with your help I may get over it.&nbsp; If you
would only do me this good turn&mdash;when I have told my father,
I mean&mdash;say that you never could have married me, you know,
or something of that sort&mdash;&rsquo;pon my life it will help
to smooth the way vastly.&nbsp; I am so anxious to win him round
to my point of view, and not to cause any
estrangement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What Phyllis replied she scarcely knew, or how she counselled
him as to his unexpected situation.&nbsp; Yet the relief that his
announcement brought her was perceptible.&nbsp; To have confided
her trouble in return was what her aching heart longed to do; and
had Humphrey been a woman she would instantly have poured out her
tale.&nbsp; But to him she feared to confess; and there was a
real reason for silence, till a sufficient time had elapsed to
allow her lover and his comrade to get out of harm&rsquo;s
way.</p>
<p>As soon as she reached home again she sought a solitary place,
and spent the time in half regretting that she had not gone away,
and in dreaming over the meetings with Matth&auml;us Tina from
their beginning to their end.&nbsp; In his own country, amongst
his own countrywomen, he would possibly soon forget her, even to
her very name.</p>
<p>Her listlessness was such that she did not go out of the house
for several days.&nbsp; There came a morning which broke in fog
and mist, behind which the dawn could be discerned in greenish
grey; and the outlines of the tents, and the rows of horses at
the ropes.&nbsp; The smoke from the canteen fires drooped
heavily.</p>
<p>The spot at the bottom of the garden where she had been
accustomed to climb the wall to meet Matth&auml;us, was the only
inch of English ground in which she took any interest; and in
spite of the disagreeable haze prevailing she walked out there
till she reached the well-known corner.&nbsp; Every blade of
grass was weighted with little liquid globes, and slugs and
snails had crept out upon the plots.&nbsp; She could hear the
usual faint noises from the camp, and in the other direction the
trot of farmers on the road to the town, for it was
market-day.&nbsp; She observed that her frequent visits to this
corner had quite trodden down the grass in the angle of the wall,
and left marks of garden soil on the stepping-stones by which she
had mounted to look over the top.&nbsp; Seldom having gone there
till dusk, she had not considered that her traces might be
visible by day.&nbsp; Perhaps it was these which had revealed her
trysts to her father.</p>
<p>While she paused in melancholy regard, she fancied that the
customary sounds from the tents were changing their
character.&nbsp; Indifferent as Phyllis was to camp doings now,
she mounted by the steps to the old place.&nbsp; What she beheld
at first awed and perplexed her; then she stood rigid, her
fingers hooked to the wall, her eyes staring out of her head, and
her face as if hardened to stone.</p>
<p>On the open green stretching before her all the regiments in
the camp were drawn up in line, in the mid-front of which two
empty coffins lay on the ground.&nbsp; The unwonted sounds which
she had noticed came from an advancing procession.&nbsp; It
consisted of the band of the York Hussars playing a dead march;
next two soldiers of that regiment in a mourning coach, guarded
on each side, and accompanied by two priests.&nbsp; Behind came a
crowd of rustics who had been attracted by the event.&nbsp; The
melancholy procession marched along the front of the line,
returned to the centre, and halted beside the coffins, where the
two condemned men were blindfolded, and each placed kneeling on
his coffin; a few minutes pause was now given, while they
prayed.</p>
<p>A firing-party of twenty-four men stood ready with levelled
carbines.&nbsp; The commanding officer, who had his sword drawn,
waved it through some cuts of the sword-exercise till he reached
the downward stroke, whereat the firing-party discharged their
volley.&nbsp; The two victims fell, one upon his face across his
coffin, the other backwards.</p>
<p>As the volley resounded there arose a shriek from the wall of
Dr. Grove&rsquo;s garden, and some one fell down inside; but
nobody among the spectators without noticed it at the time.&nbsp;
The two executed Hussars were Matth&auml;us Tina and his friend
Christoph.&nbsp; The soldiers on guard placed the bodies in the
coffins almost instantly; but the colonel of the regiment, an
Englishman, rode up and exclaimed in a stern voice: &lsquo;Turn
them out&mdash;as an example to the men!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The coffins were lifted endwise, and the dead Germans flung
out upon their faces on the grass.&nbsp; Then all the regiments
wheeled in sections, and marched past the spot in slow
time.&nbsp; When the survey was over the corpses were again
coffined, and borne away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dr. Grove, attracted by the noise of the volley, had
rushed out into his garden, where he saw his wretched daughter
lying motionless against the wall.&nbsp; She was taken indoors,
but it was long before she recovered consciousness; and for weeks
they despaired of her reason.</p>
<p>It transpired that the luckless deserters from the York
Hussars had cut the boat from her moorings in the adjacent
harbour, according to their plan, and, with two other comrades
who were smarting under ill-treatment from their colonel, had
sailed in safety across the Channel.&nbsp; But mistaking their
bearings they steered into Jersey, thinking that island the
French coast.&nbsp; Here they were perceived to be deserters, and
delivered up to the authorities.&nbsp; Matth&auml;us and
Christoph interceded for the other two at the court-martial,
saying that it was entirely by the former&rsquo;s representations
that these were induced to go.&nbsp; Their sentence was
accordingly commuted to flogging, the death punishment being
reserved for their leaders.</p>
<p>The visitor to the well-known old Georgian watering-place, who
may care to ramble to the neighbouring village under the hills,
and examine the register of burials, will there find two entries
in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Matth:&mdash;Tina (Corpl.) in His
Majesty&rsquo;s Regmt. of York Hussars, and Shot for Desertion,
was Buried June 30th, 1801, aged 22 years.&nbsp; Born in the town
of Sarrbruk, Germany.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Christoph Bless, belonging to His Majesty&rsquo;s
Regmt. of York Hussars, who was Shot for Desertion, was Buried
June 30th, 1801, aged 22 years.&nbsp; Born at Lothaargen,
Alsatia.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their graves were dug at the back of the little church, near
the wall.&nbsp; There is no memorial to mark the spot, but
Phyllis pointed it out to me.&nbsp; While she lived she used to
keep their mounds neat; but now they are overgrown with nettles,
and sunk nearly flat.&nbsp; The older villagers, however, who
know of the episode from their parents, still recollect the place
where the soldiers lie.&nbsp; Phyllis lies near.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 1889.</p>
<h2>THE FIDDLER OF THE REELS</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Talking of Exhibitions, World&rsquo;s Fairs, and what
not,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;I would not go round
the corner to see a dozen of them nowadays.&nbsp; The only
exhibition that ever made, or ever will make, any impression upon
my imagination was the first of the series, the parent of them
all, and now a thing of old times&mdash;the Great Exhibition of
1851, in Hyde Park, London.&nbsp; None of the younger generation
can realize the sense of novelty it produced in us who were then
in our prime.&nbsp; A noun substantive went so far as to become
an adjective in honour of the occasion.&nbsp; It was
&ldquo;exhibition&rdquo; hat, &ldquo;exhibition&rdquo;
razor-strop, &ldquo;exhibition&rdquo; watch; nay, even
&ldquo;exhibition&rdquo; weather, &ldquo;exhibition&rdquo;
spirits, sweethearts, babies, wives&mdash;for the time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an
extraordinary chronological frontier or transit-line, at which
there occurred what one might call a precipice in Time.&nbsp; As
in a geological &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; we had presented to us a
sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute contact, such
as probably in no other single year since the Conquest was ever
witnessed in this part of the country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These observations led us onward to talk of the different
personages, gentle and simple, who lived and moved within our
narrow and peaceful horizon at that time; and of three people in
particular, whose queer little history was oddly touched at
points by the Exhibition, more concerned with it than that of
anybody else who dwelt in those outlying shades of the world,
Stickleford, Mellstock, and Egdon.&nbsp; First in prominence
among these three came Wat Ollamoor&mdash;if that were his real
name&mdash;whom the seniors in our party had known well.</p>
<p>He was a woman&rsquo;s man, they said,&mdash;supremely
so&mdash;externally little else.&nbsp; To men he was not
attractive; perhaps a little repulsive at times.&nbsp; Musician,
dandy, and company-man in practice; veterinary surgeon in theory,
he lodged awhile in Mellstock village, coming from nobody knew
where; though some said his first appearance in this
neighbourhood had been as fiddle-player in a show at Greenhill
Fair.</p>
<p>Many a worthy villager envied him his power over
unsophisticated maidenhood&mdash;a power which seemed sometimes
to have a touch of the weird and wizardly in it.&nbsp; Personally
he was not ill-favoured, though rather un-English, his complexion
being a rich olive, his rank hair dark and rather
clammy&mdash;made still clammier by secret ointments, which, when
he came fresh to a party, caused him to smell like
&lsquo;boys&rsquo;-love&rsquo; (southernwood) steeped in
lamp-oil.&nbsp; On occasion he wore curls&mdash;a double
row&mdash;running almost horizontally around his head.&nbsp; But
as these were sometimes noticeably absent, it was concluded that
they were not altogether of Nature&rsquo;s making.&nbsp; By girls
whose love for him had turned to hatred he had been nicknamed
&lsquo;Mop,&rsquo; from this abundance of hair, which was long
enough to rest upon his shoulders; as time passed the name more
and more prevailed.</p>
<p>His fiddling possibly had the most to do with the fascination
he exercised, for, to speak fairly, it could claim for itself a
most peculiar and personal quality, like that in a moving
preacher.&nbsp; There were tones in it which bred the immediate
conviction that indolence and averseness to systematic
application were all that lay between &lsquo;Mop&rsquo; and the
career of a second Paganini.</p>
<p>While playing he invariably closed his eyes; using no notes,
and, as it were, allowing the violin to wander on at will into
the most plaintive passages ever heard by rustic man.&nbsp; There
was a certain lingual character in the supplicatory expressions
he produced, which would well nigh have drawn an ache from the
heart of a gate-post.&nbsp; He could make any child in the
parish, who was at all sensitive to music, burst into tears in a
few minutes by simply fiddling one of the old dance-tunes he
almost entirely affected&mdash;country jigs, reels, and
&lsquo;Favourite Quick Steps&rsquo; of the last
century&mdash;some mutilated remains of which even now reappear
as nameless phantoms in new quadrilles and gallops, where they
are recognized only by the curious, or by such old-fashioned and
far-between people as have been thrown with men like Wat Ollamoor
in their early life.</p>
<p>His date was a little later than that of the old Mellstock
quire-band which comprised the Dewys, Mail, and the rest&mdash;in
fact, he did not rise above the horizon thereabout till those
well-known musicians were disbanded as ecclesiastical
functionaries.&nbsp; In their honest love of thoroughness they
despised the new man&rsquo;s style.&nbsp; Theophilus Dewy (Reuben
the tranter&rsquo;s younger brother) used to say there was no
&lsquo;plumness&rsquo; in it&mdash;no bowing, no
solidity&mdash;it was all fantastical.&nbsp; And probably this
was true.&nbsp; Anyhow, Mop had, very obviously, never bowed a
note of church-music from his birth; he never once sat in the
gallery of Mellstock church where the others had tuned their
venerable psalmody so many hundreds of times; had never, in all
likelihood, entered a church at all.&nbsp; All were devil&rsquo;s
tunes in his repertory.&nbsp; &lsquo;He could no more play the
Wold Hundredth to his true time than he could play the brazen
serpent,&rsquo; the tranter would say.&nbsp; (The brazen serpent
was supposed in Mellstock to be a musical instrument particularly
hard to blow.)</p>
<p>Occasionally Mop could produce the aforesaid moving effect
upon the souls of grown-up persons, especially young women of
fragile and responsive organization.&nbsp; Such an one was
Car&rsquo;line Aspent.&nbsp; Though she was already engaged to be
married before she met him, Car&rsquo;line, of them all, was the
most influenced by Mop Ollamoor&rsquo;s heart-stealing melodies,
to her discomfort, nay, positive pain and ultimate injury.&nbsp;
She was a pretty, invocating, weak-mouthed girl, whose chief
defect as a companion with her sex was a tendency to peevishness
now and then.&nbsp; At this time she was not a resident in
Mellstock parish where Mop lodged, but lived some miles off at
Stickleford, farther down the river.</p>
<p>How and where she first made acquaintance with him and his
fiddling is not truly known, but the story was that it either
began or was developed on one spring evening, when, in passing
through Lower Mellstock, she chanced to pause on the bridge near
his house to rest herself, and languidly leaned over the
parapet.&nbsp; Mop was standing on his door-step, as was his
custom, spinning the insidious thread of semi- and
demi-semi-quavers from the E string of his fiddle for the benefit
of passers-by, and laughing as the tears rolled down the cheeks
of the little children hanging around him.&nbsp; Car&rsquo;line
pretended to be engrossed with the rippling of the stream under
the arches, but in reality she was listening, as he knew.&nbsp;
Presently the aching of the heart seized her simultaneously with
a wild desire to glide airily in the mazes of an infinite
dance.&nbsp; To shake off the fascination she resolved to go on,
although it would be necessary to pass him as he played.&nbsp; On
stealthily glancing ahead at the performer, she found to her
relief that his eyes were closed in abandonment to
instrumentation, and she strode on boldly.&nbsp; But when closer
her step grew timid, her tread convulsed itself more and more
accordantly with the time of the melody, till she very nearly
danced along.&nbsp; Gaining another glance at him when
immediately opposite, she saw that <i>one</i> of his eyes was
open, quizzing her as he smiled at her emotional state.&nbsp; Her
gait could not divest itself of its compelled capers till she had
gone a long way past the house; and Car&rsquo;line was unable to
shake off the strange infatuation for hours.</p>
<p>After that day, whenever there was to be in the neighbourhood
a dance to which she could get an invitation, and where Mop
Ollamoor was to be the musician, Car&rsquo;line contrived to be
present, though it sometimes involved a walk of several miles;
for he did not play so often in Stickleford as elsewhere.</p>
<p>The next evidences of his influence over her were singular
enough, and it would require a neurologist to fully explain
them.&nbsp; She would be sitting quietly, any evening after dark,
in the house of her father, the parish clerk, which stood in the
middle of Stickleford village street, this being the highroad
between Lower Mellstock and Moreford, five miles eastward.&nbsp;
Here, without a moment&rsquo;s warning, and in the midst of a
general conversation between her father, sister, and the young
man before alluded to, who devotedly wooed her in ignorance of
her infatuation, she would start from her seat in the
chimney-corner as if she had received a galvanic shock, and
spring convulsively towards the ceiling; then she would burst
into tears, and it was not till some half-hour had passed that
she grew calm as usual.&nbsp; Her father, knowing her hysterical
tendencies, was always excessively anxious about this trait in
his youngest girl, and feared the attack to be a species of
epileptic fit.&nbsp; Not so her sister Julia.&nbsp; Julia had
found out what was the cause.&nbsp; At the moment before the
jumping, only an exceptionally sensitive ear situated in the
chimney-nook could have caught from down the flue the beat of a
man&rsquo;s footstep along the highway without.&nbsp; But it was
in that footfall, for which she had been waiting, that the origin
of Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s involuntary springing lay.&nbsp; The
pedestrian was Mop Ollamoor, as the girl well knew; but his
business that way was not to visit her; he sought another woman
whom he spoke of as his Intended, and who lived at Moreford, two
miles farther on.&nbsp; On one, and only one, occasion did it
happen that Car&rsquo;line could not control her utterance; it
was when her sister alone chanced to be present.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh&mdash;!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to <i>her</i>, and not coming to
<i>me</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>To do the fiddler justice he had not at first thought greatly
of, or spoken much to, this girl of impressionable mould.&nbsp;
But he had soon found out her secret, and could not resist a
little by-play with her too easily hurt heart, as an interlude
between his more serious performances at Moreford.&nbsp; The two
became well acquainted, though only by stealth, hardly a soul in
Stickleford except her sister, and her lover Ned Hipcroft, being
aware of the attachment.&nbsp; Her father disapproved of her
coldness to Ned; her sister, too, hoped she might get over this
nervous passion for a man of whom so little was known.&nbsp; The
ultimate result was that Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s manly and simple
wooer Edward found his suit becoming practically hopeless.&nbsp;
He was a respectable mechanic, in a far sounder position than Mop
the nominal horse-doctor; but when, before leaving her, Ned put
his flat and final question, would she marry him, then and there,
now or never, it was with little expectation of obtaining more
than the negative she gave him.&nbsp; Though her father supported
him and her sister supported him, he could not play the fiddle so
as to draw your soul out of your body like a spider&rsquo;s
thread, as Mop did, till you felt as limp as withy-wind and
yearned for something to cling to.&nbsp; Indeed, Hipcroft had not
the slightest ear for music; could not sing two notes in tune,
much less play them.</p>
<p>The No he had expected and got from her, in spite of a
preliminary encouragement, gave Ned a new start in life.&nbsp; It
had been uttered in such a tone of sad entreaty that he resolved
to persecute her no more; she should not even be distressed by a
sight of his form in the distant perspective of the street and
lane.&nbsp; He left the place, and his natural course was to
London.</p>
<p>The railway to South Wessex was in process of construction,
but it was not as yet opened for traffic; and Hipcroft reached
the capital by a six days&rsquo; trudge on foot, as many a better
man had done before him.&nbsp; He was one of the last of the
artisan class who used that now extinct method of travel to the
great centres of labour, so customary then from time
immemorial.</p>
<p>In London he lived and worked regularly at his trade.&nbsp;
More fortunate than many, his disinterested willingness
recommended him from the first.&nbsp; During the ensuing four
years he was never out of employment.&nbsp; He neither advanced
nor receded in the modern sense; he improved as a workman, but he
did not shift one jot in social position.&nbsp; About his love
for Car&rsquo;line he maintained a rigid silence.&nbsp; No doubt
he often thought of her; but being always occupied, and having no
relations at Stickleford, he held no communication with that part
of the country, and showed no desire to return.&nbsp; In his
quiet lodging in Lambeth he moved about after working-hours with
the facility of a woman, doing his own cooking, attending to his
stocking-heels, and shaping himself by degrees to a life-long
bachelorhood.&nbsp; For this conduct one is bound to advance the
canonical reason that time could not efface from his heart the
image of little Car&rsquo;line Aspent&mdash;and it may be in part
true; but there was also the inference that his was a nature not
greatly dependent upon the ministrations of the other sex for its
comforts.</p>
<p>The fourth year of his residence as a mechanic in London was
the year of the Hyde-Park Exhibition already mentioned, and at
the construction of this huge glass-house, then unexampled in the
world&rsquo;s history, he worked daily.&nbsp; It was an era of
great hope and activity among the nations and industries.&nbsp;
Though Hipcroft was, in his small way, a central man in the
movement, he plodded on with his usual outward placidity.&nbsp;
Yet for him, too, the year was destined to have its surprises,
for when the bustle of getting the building ready for the opening
day was past, the ceremonies had been witnessed, and people were
flocking thither from all parts of the globe, he received a
letter from Car&rsquo;line.&nbsp; Till that day the silence of
four years between himself and Stickleford had never been
broken.</p>
<p>She informed her old lover, in an uncertain penmanship which
suggested a trembling hand, of the trouble she had been put to in
ascertaining his address, and then broached the subject which had
prompted her to write.&nbsp; Four years ago, she said with the
greatest delicacy of which she was capable, she had been so
foolish as to refuse him.&nbsp; Her wilful wrong-headedness had
since been a grief to her many times, and of late
particularly.&nbsp; As for Mr. Ollamoor, he had been absent
almost as long as Ned&mdash;she did not know where.&nbsp; She
would gladly marry Ned now if he were to ask her again, and be a
tender little wife to him till her life&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>A tide of warm feeling must have surged through Ned
Hipcroft&rsquo;s frame on receipt of this news, if we may judge
by the issue.&nbsp; Unquestionably he loved her still, even if
not to the exclusion of every other happiness.&nbsp; This from
his Car&rsquo;line, she who had been dead to him these many
years, alive to him again as of old, was in itself a pleasant,
gratifying thing.&nbsp; Ned had grown so resigned to, or
satisfied with, his lonely lot, that he probably would not have
shown much jubilation at anything.&nbsp; Still, a certain ardour
of preoccupation, after his first surprise, revealed how deeply
her confession of faith in him had stirred him.&nbsp; Measured
and methodical in his ways, he did not answer the letter that
day, nor the next, nor the next.&nbsp; He was having &lsquo;a
good think.&rsquo;&nbsp; When he did answer it, there was a great
deal of sound reasoning mixed in with the unmistakable tenderness
of his reply; but the tenderness itself was sufficient to reveal
that he was pleased with her straightforward frankness; that the
anchorage she had once obtained in his heart was renewable, if it
had not been continuously firm.</p>
<p>He told her&mdash;and as he wrote his lips twitched humorously
over the few gentle words of raillery he indited among the rest
of his sentences&mdash;that it was all very well for her to come
round at this time of day.&nbsp; Why wouldn&rsquo;t she have him
when he wanted her?&nbsp; She had no doubt learned that he was
not married, but suppose his affections had since been fixed on
another?&nbsp; She ought to beg his pardon.&nbsp; Still, he was
not the man to forget her.&nbsp; But considering how he had been
used, and what he had suffered, she could not quite expect him to
go down to Stickleford and fetch her.&nbsp; But if she would come
to him, and say she was sorry, as was only fair; why, yes, he
would marry her, knowing what a good little woman she was at the
core.&nbsp; He added that the request for her to come to him was
a less one to make than it would have been when he first left
Stickleford, or even a few months ago; for the new railway into
South Wessex was now open, and there had just begun to be run
wonderfully contrived special trains, called excursion-trains, on
account of the Great Exhibition; so that she could come up easily
alone.</p>
<p>She said in her reply how good it was of him to treat her so
generously, after her hot and cold treatment of him; that though
she felt frightened at the magnitude of the journey, and was
never as yet in a railway-train, having only seen one pass at a
distance, she embraced his offer with all her heart; and would,
indeed, own to him how sorry she was, and beg his pardon, and try
to be a good wife always, and make up for lost time.</p>
<p>The remaining details of when and where were soon settled,
Car&rsquo;line informing him, for her ready identification in the
crowd, that she would be wearing &lsquo;my new sprigged-laylock
cotton gown,&rsquo; and Ned gaily responding that, having married
her the morning after her arrival, he would make a day of it by
taking her to the Exhibition.&nbsp; One early summer afternoon,
accordingly, he came from his place of work, and hastened towards
Waterloo Station to meet her.&nbsp; It was as wet and chilly as
an English June day can occasionally be, but as he waited on the
platform in the drizzle he glowed inwardly, and seemed to have
something to live for again.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;excursion-train&rsquo;&mdash;an absolutely new
departure in the history of travel&mdash;was still a novelty on
the Wessex line, and probably everywhere.&nbsp; Crowds of people
had flocked to all the stations on the way up to witness the
unwonted sight of so long a train&rsquo;s passage, even where
they did not take advantage of the opportunity it offered.&nbsp;
The seats for the humbler class of travellers in these early
experiments in steam-locomotion, were open trucks, without any
protection whatever from the wind and rain; and damp weather
having set in with the afternoon, the unfortunate occupants of
these vehicles were, on the train drawing up at the London
terminus, found to be in a pitiable condition from their long
journey; blue-faced, stiff-necked, sneezing, rain-beaten, chilled
to the marrow, many of the men being hatless; in fact, they
resembled people who had been out all night in an open boat on a
rough sea, rather than inland excursionists for pleasure.&nbsp;
The women had in some degree protected themselves by turning up
the skirts of their gowns over their heads, but as by this
arrangement they were additionally exposed about the hips, they
were all more or less in a sorry plight.</p>
<p>In the bustle and crush of alighting forms of both sexes which
followed the entry of the huge concatenation into the station,
Ned Hipcroft soon discerned the slim little figure his eye was in
search of, in the sprigged lilac, as described.&nbsp; She came up
to him with a frightened smile&mdash;still pretty, though so
damp, weather-beaten, and shivering from long exposure to the
wind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Ned!&rsquo; she sputtered,
&lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; He clasped her in his arms
and kissed her, whereupon she burst into a flood of tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are wet, my poor dear!&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll
not get cold,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; And surveying her and her
multifarious surrounding packages, he noticed that by the hand
she led a toddling child&mdash;a little girl of three or
so&mdash;whose hood was as clammy and tender face as blue as
those of the other travellers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is this&mdash;somebody you know?&rsquo; asked Ned
curiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Ned.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;my own!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your own child?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;as God&rsquo;s in&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ned, I didn&rsquo;t name it in my letter, because, you
see, it would have been so hard to explain!&nbsp; I thought that
when we met I could tell you how she happened to be born, so much
better than in writing!&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse it this
once, dear Ned, and not scold me, now I&rsquo;ve come so many,
many miles!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This means Mr. Mop Ollamoor, I reckon!&rsquo; said
Hipcroft, gazing palely at them from the distance of the yard or
two to which he had withdrawn with a start.</p>
<p>Car&rsquo;line gasped.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he&rsquo;s been gone
away for years!&rsquo; she supplicated.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I never
had a young man before!&nbsp; And I was so onlucky to be catched
the first time, though some of the girls down there go on like
anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ned remained in silence, pondering.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll forgive me, dear Ned?&rsquo; she added,
beginning to sob outright.&nbsp; &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t taken
&rsquo;ee in after all, because&mdash;because you can pack us
back again, if you want to; though &rsquo;tis hundreds o&rsquo;
miles, and so wet, and night a-coming on, and I with no
money!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the devil can I do!&rsquo; Hipcroft groaned.</p>
<p>A more pitiable picture than the pair of helpless creatures
presented was never seen on a rainy day, as they stood on the
great, gaunt, puddled platform, a whiff of drizzle blowing under
the roof upon them now and then; the pretty attire in which they
had started from Stickleford in the early morning bemuddled and
sodden, weariness on their faces, and fear of him in their eyes;
for the child began to look as if she thought she too had done
some wrong, remaining in an appalled silence till the tears
rolled down her chubby cheeks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my little maid?&rsquo; said
Ned mechanically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do want to go home!&rsquo; she let out, in tones that
told of a bursting heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;And my totties be cold,
an&rsquo; I shan&rsquo;t have no bread an&rsquo; butter no
more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say to it all!&rsquo;
declared Ned, his own eye moist as he turned and walked a few
steps with his head down; then regarded them again point
blank.&nbsp; From the child escaped troubled breaths and silently
welling tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Want some bread and butter, do &rsquo;ee?&rsquo; he
said, with factitious hardness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ye-e-s!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I daresay I can get &rsquo;ee a bit!&nbsp;
Naturally, you must want some.&nbsp; And you, too, for that
matter, Car&rsquo;line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do feel a little hungered.&nbsp; But I can keep it
off,&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Folk shouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; he said gruffly. .
. . &lsquo;There come along!&rsquo; he caught up the child, as he
added, &lsquo;You must bide here to-night, anyhow, I
s&rsquo;pose!&nbsp; What can you do otherwise?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
get &rsquo;ee some tea and victuals; and as for this job,
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what to say!&nbsp; This is the
way out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They pursued their way, without speaking, to Ned&rsquo;s
lodgings, which were not far off.&nbsp; There he dried them and
made them comfortable, and prepared tea; they thankfully sat
down.&nbsp; The ready-made household of which he suddenly found
himself the head imparted a cosy aspect to his room, and a
paternal one to himself.&nbsp; Presently he turned to the child
and kissed her now blooming cheeks; and, looking wistfully at
Car&rsquo;line, kissed her also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can send &rsquo;ee back all
them miles,&rsquo; he growled, &lsquo;now you&rsquo;ve come all
the way o&rsquo; purpose to join me.&nbsp; But you must trust me,
Car&rsquo;line, and show you&rsquo;ve real faith in me.&nbsp;
Well, do you feel better now, my little woman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The child nodded, her mouth being otherwise occupied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did trust you, Ned, in coming; and I shall
always!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus, without any definite agreement to forgive her, he
tacitly acquiesced in the fate that Heaven had sent him; and on
the day of their marriage (which was not quite so soon as he had
expected it could be, on account of the time necessary for banns)
he took her to the Exhibition when they came back from church, as
he had promised.&nbsp; While standing near a large mirror in one
of the courts devoted to furniture, Car&rsquo;line started, for
in the glass appeared the reflection of a form exactly resembling
Mop Ollamoor&rsquo;s&mdash;so exactly, that it seemed impossible
to believe anybody but that artist in person to be the
original.&nbsp; On passing round the objects which hemmed in Ned,
her, and the child from a direct view, no Mop was to be
seen.&nbsp; Whether he were really in London or not at that time
was never known; and Car&rsquo;line always stoutly denied that
her readiness to go and meet Ned in town arose from any rumour
that Mop had also gone thither; which denial there was no
reasonable ground for doubting.</p>
<p>And then the year glided away, and the Exhibition folded
itself up and became a thing of the past.&nbsp; The park trees
that had been enclosed for six months were again exposed to the
winds and storms, and the sod grew green anew.&nbsp; Ned found
that Car&rsquo;line resolved herself into a very good wife and
companion, though she had made herself what is called cheap to
him; but in that she was like another domestic article, a cheap
tea-pot, which often brews better tea than a dear one.&nbsp; One
autumn Hipcroft found himself with but little work to do, and a
prospect of less for the winter.&nbsp; Both being country born
and bred, they fancied they would like to live again in their
natural atmosphere.&nbsp; It was accordingly decided between them
that they should leave the pent-up London lodging, and that Ned
should seek out employment near his native place, his wife and
her daughter staying with Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s father during
the search for occupation and an abode of their own.</p>
<p>Tinglings of pleasure pervaded Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s
spasmodic little frame as she journeyed down with Ned to the
place she had left two or three years before, in silence and
under a cloud.&nbsp; To return to where she had once been
despised, a smiling London wife with a distinct London accent,
was a triumph which the world did not witness every day.</p>
<p>The train did not stop at the petty roadside station that lay
nearest to Stickleford, and the trio went on to
Casterbridge.&nbsp; Ned thought it a good opportunity to make a
few preliminary inquiries for employment at workshops in the
borough where he had been known; and feeling cold from her
journey, and it being dry underfoot and only dusk as yet, with a
moon on the point of rising, Car&rsquo;line and her little girl
walked on toward Stickleford, leaving Ned to follow at a quicker
pace, and pick her up at a certain half-way house, widely known
as an inn.</p>
<p>The woman and child pursued the well-remembered way
comfortably enough, though they were both becoming wearied.&nbsp;
In the course of three miles they had passed
Heedless-William&rsquo;s Pond, the familiar landmark by
Bloom&rsquo;s End, and were drawing near the Quiet Woman Inn, a
lone roadside hostel on the lower verge of the Egdon Heath, since
and for many years abolished.&nbsp; In stepping up towards it
Car&rsquo;line heard more voices within than had formerly been
customary at such an hour, and she learned that an auction of fat
stock had been held near the spot that afternoon.&nbsp; The child
would be the better for a rest as well as herself, she thought,
and she entered.</p>
<p>The guests and customers overflowed into the passage, and
Car&rsquo;line had no sooner crossed the threshold than a man
whom she remembered by sight came forward with glass and mug in
his hands towards a friend leaning against the wall; but, seeing
her, very gallantly offered her a drink of the liquor, which was
gin-and-beer hot, pouring her out a tumblerful and saying, in a
moment or two: &lsquo;Surely, &rsquo;tis little Car&rsquo;line
Aspent that was&mdash;down at Stickleford?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She assented, and, though she did not exactly want this
beverage, she drank it since it was offered, and her entertainer
begged her to come in farther and sit down.&nbsp; Once within the
room she found that all the persons present were seated close
against the walls, and there being a chair vacant she did the
same.&nbsp; An explanation of their position occurred the next
moment.&nbsp; In the opposite corner stood Mop, rosining his bow
and looking just the same as ever.&nbsp; The company had cleared
the middle of the room for dancing, and they were about to dance
again.&nbsp; As she wore a veil to keep off the wind she did not
think he had recognized her, or could possibly guess the identity
of the child; and to her satisfied surprise she found that she
could confront him quite calmly&mdash;mistress of herself in the
dignity her London life had given her.&nbsp; Before she had quite
emptied her glass the dance was called, the dancers formed in two
lines, the music sounded, and the figure began.</p>
<p>Then matters changed for Car&rsquo;line.&nbsp; A tremor
quickened itself to life in her, and her hand so shook that she
could hardly set down her glass.&nbsp; It was not the dance nor
the dancers, but the notes of that old violin which thrilled the
London wife, these having still all the witchery that she had so
well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her
power of independent will.&nbsp; How it all came back!&nbsp;
There was the fiddling figure against the wall; the large, oily,
mop-like head of him, and beneath the mop the face with closed
eyes.</p>
<p>After the first moments of paralyzed reverie the familiar tune
in the familiar rendering made her laugh and shed tears
simultaneously.&nbsp; Then a man at the bottom of the dance,
whose partner had dropped away, stretched out his hand and
beckoned to her to take the place.&nbsp; She did not want to
dance; she entreated by signs to be left where she was, but she
was entreating of the tune and its player rather than of the
dancing man.&nbsp; The saltatory tendency which the fiddler and
his cunning instrument had ever been able to start in her was
seizing Car&rsquo;line just as it had done in earlier years,
possibly assisted by the gin-and-beer hot.&nbsp; Tired as she was
she grasped her little girl by the hand, and plunging in at the
bottom of the figure, whirled about with the rest.&nbsp; She
found that her companions were mostly people of the neighbouring
hamlets and farms&mdash;Bloom&rsquo;s End, Mellstock, Lewgate,
and elsewhere; and by degrees she was recognized as she
convulsively danced on, wishing that Mop would cease and let her
heart rest from the aching he caused, and her feet also.</p>
<p>After long and many minutes the dance ended, when she was
urged to fortify herself with more gin-and-beer; which she did,
feeling very weak and overpowered with hysteric emotion.&nbsp;
She refrained from unveiling, to keep Mop in ignorance of her
presence, if possible.&nbsp; Several of the guests having left,
Car&rsquo;line hastily wiped her lips and also turned to go; but,
according to the account of some who remained, at that very
moment a five-handed reel was proposed, in which two or three
begged her to join.</p>
<p>She declined on the plea of being tired and having to walk to
Stickleford, when Mop began aggressively tweedling &lsquo;My
Fancy-Lad,&rsquo; in D major, as the air to which the reel was to
be footed.&nbsp; He must have recognized her, though she did not
know it, for it was the strain of all seductive strains which she
was least able to resist&mdash;the one he had played when she was
leaning over the bridge at the date of their first
acquaintance.&nbsp; Car&rsquo;line stepped despairingly into the
middle of the room with the other four.</p>
<p>Reels were resorted to hereabouts at this time by the more
robust spirits, for the reduction of superfluous energy which the
ordinary figure-dances were not powerful enough to exhaust.&nbsp;
As everybody knows, or does not know, the five reelers stood in
the form of a cross, the reel being performed by each line of
three alternately, the persons who successively came to the
middle place dancing in both directions.&nbsp; Car&rsquo;line
soon found herself in this place, the axis of the whole
performance, and could not get out of it, the tune turning into
the first part without giving her opportunity.&nbsp; And now she
began to suspect that Mop did know her, and was doing this on
purpose, though whenever she stole a glance at him his closed
eyes betokened obliviousness to everything outside his own
brain.&nbsp; She continued to wend her way through the figure of
8 that was formed by her course, the fiddler introducing into his
notes the wild and agonizing sweetness of a living voice in one
too highly wrought; its pathos running high and running low in
endless variation, projecting through her nerves excruciating
spasms, a sort of blissful torture.&nbsp; The room swam, the tune
was endless; and in about a quarter of an hour the only other
woman in the figure dropped out exhausted, and sank panting on a
bench.</p>
<p>The reel instantly resolved itself into a four-handed
one.&nbsp; Car&rsquo;line would have given anything to leave off;
but she had, or fancied she had, no power, while Mop played such
tunes; and thus another ten minutes slipped by, a haze of dust
now clouding the candles, the floor being of stone, sanded.&nbsp;
Then another dancer fell out&mdash;one of the men&mdash;and went
into the passage, in a frantic search for liquor.&nbsp; To turn
the figure into a three-handed reel was the work of a second, Mop
modulating at the same time into &lsquo;The Fairy Dance,&rsquo;
as better suited to the contracted movement, and no less one of
those foods of love which, as manufactured by his bow, had always
intoxicated her.</p>
<p>In a reel for three there was no rest whatever, and four or
five minutes were enough to make her remaining two partners, now
thoroughly blown, stamp their last bar and, like their
predecessors, limp off into the next room to get something to
drink.&nbsp; Car&rsquo;line, half-stifled inside her veil, was
left dancing alone, the apartment now being empty of everybody
save herself, Mop, and their little girl.</p>
<p>She flung up the veil, and cast her eyes upon him, as if
imploring him to withdraw himself and his acoustic magnetism from
the atmosphere.&nbsp; Mop opened one of his own orbs, as though
for the first time, fixed it peeringly upon her, and smiling
dreamily, threw into his strains the reserve of expression which
he could not afford to waste on a big and noisy dance.&nbsp;
Crowds of little chromatic subtleties, capable of drawing tears
from a statue, proceeded straightway from the ancient fiddle, as
if it were dying of the emotion which had been pent up within it
ever since its banishment from some Italian city where it first
took shape and sound.&nbsp; There was that in the look of
Mop&rsquo;s one dark eye which said: &lsquo;You cannot leave off,
dear, whether you would or no!&rsquo; and it bred in her a
paroxysm of desperation that defied him to tire her down.</p>
<p>She thus continued to dance alone, defiantly as she thought,
but in truth slavishly and abjectly, subject to every wave of the
melody, and probed by the gimlet-like gaze of her
fascinator&rsquo;s open eye; keeping up at the same time a feeble
smile in his face, as a feint to signify it was still her own
pleasure which led her on.&nbsp; A terrified embarrassment as to
what she could say to him if she were to leave off, had its
unrecognized share in keeping her going.&nbsp; The child, who was
beginning to be distressed by the strange situation, came up and
said: &lsquo;Stop, mother, stop, and let&rsquo;s go home!&rsquo;
as she seized Car&rsquo;line&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly Car&rsquo;line sank staggering to the floor; and
rolling over on her face, prone she remained.&nbsp; Mop&rsquo;s
fiddle thereupon emitted an elfin shriek of finality; stepping
quickly down from the nine-gallon beer-cask which had formed his
rostrum, he went to the little girl, who disconsolately bent over
her mother.</p>
<p>The guests who had gone into the back-room for liquor and
change of air, hearing something unusual, trooped back
hitherward, where they endeavoured to revive poor, weak
Car&rsquo;line by blowing her with the bellows and opening the
window.&nbsp; Ned, her husband, who had been detained in
Casterbridge, as aforesaid, came along the road at this juncture,
and hearing excited voices through the open casement, and to his
great surprise, the mention of his wife&rsquo;s name, he entered
amid the rest upon the scene.&nbsp; Car&rsquo;line was now in
convulsions, weeping violently, and for a long time nothing could
be done with her.&nbsp; While he was sending for a cart to take
her onward to Stickleford Hipcroft anxiously inquired how it had
all happened; and then the assembly explained that a fiddler
formerly known in the locality had lately revisited his old
haunts, and had taken upon himself without invitation to play
that evening at the inn.</p>
<p>Ned demanded the fiddler&rsquo;s name, and they said
Ollamoor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; exclaimed Ned, looking round him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Where is he, and where&mdash;where&rsquo;s my little
girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ollamoor had disappeared, and so had the child.&nbsp; Hipcroft
was in ordinary a quiet and tractable fellow, but a determination
which was to be feared settled in his face now.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Blast him!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll beat
his skull in for&rsquo;n, if I swing for it to-morrow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had rushed to the poker which lay on the hearth, and
hastened down the passage, the people following.&nbsp; Outside
the house, on the other side of the highway, a mass of dark
heath-land rose sullenly upward to its not easily accessible
interior, a ravined plateau, whereon jutted into the sky, at the
distance of a couple of miles, the fir-woods of Mistover backed
by the Yalbury coppices&mdash;a place of Dantesque gloom at this
hour, which would have afforded secure hiding for a battery of
artillery, much less a man and a child.</p>
<p>Some other men plunged thitherward with him, and more went
along the road.&nbsp; They were gone about twenty minutes
altogether, returning without result to the inn.&nbsp; Ned sat
down in the settle, and clasped his forehead with his hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;what a fool the man is, and hev been all
these years, if he thinks the child his, as a&rsquo; do seem
to!&rsquo; they whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;And everybody else
knowing otherwise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think &rsquo;tis mine!&rsquo; cried
Ned hoarsely, as he looked up from his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
she is mine, all the same!&nbsp; Ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I nussed
her?&nbsp; Ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I fed her and teached her?&nbsp;
Ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I played wi&rsquo; her?&nbsp; O, little
Carry&mdash;gone with that rogue&mdash;gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t lost your mis&rsquo;ess,
anyhow,&rsquo; they said to console him.&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
throwed up the sperrits, and she is feeling better, and
she&rsquo;s more to &rsquo;ee than a child that isn&rsquo;t
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She isn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not so particular
much to me, especially now she&rsquo;s lost the little
maid!&nbsp; But Carry&rsquo;s everything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, ver&rsquo; like you&rsquo;ll find her
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;but shall I?&nbsp; Yet he <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
hurt her&mdash;surely he can&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
Well&mdash;how&rsquo;s Car&rsquo;line now?&nbsp; I am
ready.&nbsp; Is the cart here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was lifted into the vehicle, and they sadly lumbered on
toward Stickleford.&nbsp; Next day she was calmer; but the fits
were still upon her; and her will seemed shattered.&nbsp; For the
child she appeared to show singularly little anxiety, though Ned
was nearly distracted.&nbsp; It was nevertheless quite expected
that the impish Mop would restore the lost one after a freak of a
day or two; but time went on, and neither he nor she could be
heard of, and Hipcroft murmured that perhaps he was exercising
upon her some unholy musical charm, as he had done upon
Car&rsquo;line herself.&nbsp; Weeks passed, and still they could
obtain no clue either to the fiddler&rsquo;s whereabouts or the
girl&rsquo;s; and how he could have induced her to go with him
remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Then Ned, who had obtained only temporary employment in the
neighbourhood, took a sudden hatred toward his native district,
and a rumour reaching his ears through the police that a somewhat
similar man and child had been seen at a fair near London, he
playing a violin, she dancing on stilts, a new interest in the
capital took possession of Hipcroft with an intensity which would
scarcely allow him time to pack before returning thither.</p>
<p>He did not, however, find the lost one, though he made it the
entire business of his over-hours to stand about in by-streets in
the hope of discovering her, and would start up in the night,
saying, &lsquo;That rascal&rsquo;s torturing her to maintain
him!&rsquo;&nbsp; To which his wife would answer peevishly,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ee raft yourself so, Ned!&nbsp; You
prevent my getting a bit o&rsquo; rest!&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t hurt
her!&rsquo; and fall asleep again.</p>
<p>That Carry and her father had emigrated to America was the
general opinion; Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly
desirable companion when he had trained her to keep him by her
earnings as a dancer.&nbsp; There, for that matter, they may be
performing in some capacity now, though he must be an old scamp
verging on threescore-and-ten, and she a woman of
four-and-forty.</p>
<p>May 1893,</p>
<h2>A TRADITION OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FOUR</h2>
<p>The widely discussed possibility of an invasion of England
through a Channel tunnel has more than once recalled old Solomon
Selby&rsquo;s story to my mind.</p>
<p>The occasion on which I numbered myself among his audience was
one evening when he was sitting in the yawning chimney-corner of
the inn-kitchen, with some others who had gathered there, and I
entered for shelter from the rain.&nbsp; Withdrawing the stem of
his pipe from the dental notch in which it habitually rested, he
leaned back in the recess behind him and smiled into the
fire.&nbsp; The smile was neither mirthful nor sad, not precisely
humorous nor altogether thoughtful.&nbsp; We who knew him
recognized it in a moment: it was his narrative smile.&nbsp;
Breaking off our few desultory remarks we drew up closer, and he
thus began:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father, as you mid know, was a shepherd all his
life, and lived out by the Cove four miles yonder, where I was
born and lived likewise, till I moved here shortly afore I was
married.&nbsp; The cottage that first knew me stood on the top of
the down, near the sea; there was no house within a mile and a
half of it; it was built o&rsquo; purpose for the farm-shepherd,
and had no other use.&nbsp; They tell me that it is now pulled
down, but that you can see where it stood by the mounds of earth
and a few broken bricks that are still lying about.&nbsp; It was
a bleak and dreary place in winter-time, but in summer it was
well enough, though the garden never came to much, because we
could not get up a good shelter for the vegetables and currant
bushes; and where there is much wind they don&rsquo;t thrive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of all the years of my growing up the ones that bide
clearest in my mind were eighteen hundred and three, four, and
five.&nbsp; This was for two reasons: I had just then grown to an
age when a child&rsquo;s eyes and ears take in and note down
everything about him, and there was more at that date to bear in
mind than there ever has been since with me.&nbsp; It was, as I
need hardly tell ye, the time after the first peace, when
Bonaparte was scheming his descent upon England.&nbsp; He had
crossed the great Alp mountains, fought in Egypt, drubbed the
Turks, the Austrians, and the Proossians, and now thought
he&rsquo;d have a slap at us.&nbsp; On the other side of the
Channel, scarce out of sight and hail of a man standing on our
English shore, the French army of a hundred and sixty thousand
men and fifteen thousand horses had been brought together from
all parts, and were drilling every day.&nbsp; Bonaparte had been
three years a-making his preparations; and to ferry these
soldiers and cannon and horses across he had contrived a couple
of thousand flat-bottomed boats.&nbsp; These boats were small
things, but wonderfully built.&nbsp; A good few of &rsquo;em were
so made as to have a little stable on board each for the two
horses that were to haul the cannon carried at the stern.&nbsp;
To get in order all these, and other things required, he had
assembled there five or six thousand fellows that worked at
trades&mdash;carpenters, blacksmiths, wheelwrights, saddlers, and
what not.&nbsp; O &rsquo;twas a curious time!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every morning Neighbour Boney would muster his
multitude of soldiers on the beach, draw &rsquo;em up in line,
practise &rsquo;em in the manoeuvre of embarking, horses and all,
till they could do it without a single hitch.&nbsp; My father
drove a flock of ewes up into Sussex that year, and as he went
along the drover&rsquo;s track over the high downs thereabout he
could see this drilling actually going on&mdash;the accoutrements
of the rank and file glittering in the sun like silver.&nbsp; It
was thought and always said by my uncle Job, sergeant of foot
(who used to know all about these matters), that Bonaparte meant
to cross with oars on a calm night.&nbsp; The grand query with us
was, Where would my gentleman land?&nbsp; Many of the common
people thought it would be at Dover; others, who knew how
unlikely it was that any skilful general would make a business of
landing just where he was expected, said he&rsquo;d go either
east into the River Thames, or west&rsquo;ard to some convenient
place, most likely one of the little bays inside the Isle of
Portland, between the Beal and St. Alban&rsquo;s Head&mdash;and
for choice the three-quarter-round Cove, screened from every
mortal eye, that seemed made o&rsquo; purpose, out by where we
lived, and which I&rsquo;ve climmed up with two tubs of brandy
across my shoulders on scores o&rsquo; dark nights in my younger
days.&nbsp; Some had heard that a part o&rsquo; the French fleet
would sail right round Scotland, and come up the Channel to a
suitable haven.&nbsp; However, there was much doubt upon the
matter; and no wonder, for after-years proved that Bonaparte
himself could hardly make up his mind upon that great and very
particular point, where to land.&nbsp; His uncertainty came about
in this wise, that he could get no news as to where and how our
troops lay in waiting, and that his knowledge of possible places
where flat-bottomed boats might be quietly run ashore, and the
men they brought marshalled in order, was dim to the last
degree.&nbsp; Being flat-bottomed, they didn&rsquo;t require a
harbour for unshipping their cargo of men, but a good shelving
beach away from sight, and with a fair open road toward
London.&nbsp; How the question posed that great Corsican tyrant
(as we used to call him), what pains he took to settle it, and,
above all, what a risk he ran on one particular night in trying
to do so, were known only to one man here and there; and
certainly to no maker of newspapers or printer of books, or my
account o&rsquo;t would not have had so many heads shaken over it
as it has by gentry who only believe what they see in printed
lines.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The flocks my father had charge of fed all about the
downs near our house, overlooking the sea and shore each way for
miles.&nbsp; In winter and early spring father was up a deal at
nights, watching and tending the lambing.&nbsp; Often he&rsquo;d
go to bed early, and turn out at twelve or one; and on the other
hand, he&rsquo;d sometimes stay up till twelve or one, and then
turn in to bed.&nbsp; As soon as I was old enough I used to help
him, mostly in the way of keeping an eye upon the ewes while he
was gone home to rest.&nbsp; This is what I was doing in a
particular month in either the year four or five&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t certainly fix which, but it was long before I was
took away from the sheepkeeping to be bound prentice to a
trade.&nbsp; Every night at that time I was at the fold, about
half a mile, or it may be a little more, from our cottage, and no
living thing at all with me but the ewes and young lambs.&nbsp;
Afeard?&nbsp; No; I was never afeard of being alone at these
times; for I had been reared in such an out-step place that the
lack o&rsquo; human beings at night made me less fearful than the
sight of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Directly I saw a man&rsquo;s shape
after dark in a lonely place I was frightened out of my
senses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day in that month we were surprised by a visit from
my uncle Job, the sergeant in the Sixty-first foot, then in camp
on the downs above King George&rsquo;s watering-place, several
miles to the west yonder.&nbsp; Uncle Job dropped in about dusk,
and went up with my father to the fold for an hour or two.&nbsp;
Then he came home, had a drop to drink from the tub of sperrits
that the smugglers kept us in for housing their liquor when
they&rsquo;d made a run, and for burning &rsquo;em off when there
was danger.&nbsp; After that he stretched himself out on the
settle to sleep.&nbsp; I went to bed: at one o&rsquo;clock father
came home, and waking me to go and take his place, according to
custom, went to bed himself.&nbsp; On my way out of the house I
passed Uncle Job on the settle.&nbsp; He opened his eyes, and
upon my telling him where I was going he said it was a shame that
such a youngster as I should go up there all alone; and when he
had fastened up his stock and waist-belt he set off along with
me, taking a drop from the sperrit-tub in a little flat bottle
that stood in the corner-cupboard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By and by we drew up to the fold, saw that all was
right, and then, to keep ourselves warm, curled up in a heap of
straw that lay inside the thatched hurdles we had set up to break
the stroke of the wind when there was any.&nbsp; To-night,
however, there was none.&nbsp; It was one of those very still
nights when, if you stand on the high hills anywhere within two
or three miles of the sea, you can hear the rise and fall of the
tide along the shore, coming and going every few moments like a
sort of great snore of the sleeping world.&nbsp; Over the lower
ground there was a bit of a mist, but on the hill where we lay
the air was clear, and the moon, then in her last quarter, flung
a fairly good light on the grass and scattered straw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While we lay there Uncle Job amused me by telling me
strange stories of the wars he had served in and the wounds he
had got.&nbsp; He had already fought the French in the Low
Countries, and hoped to fight &rsquo;em again.&nbsp; His stories
lasted so long that at last I was hardly sure that I was not a
soldier myself, and had seen such service as he told of.&nbsp;
The wonders of his tales quite bewildered my mind, till I fell
asleep and dreamed of battle, smoke, and flying soldiers, all of
a kind with the doings he had been bringing up to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long my nap lasted I am not prepared to say.&nbsp;
But some faint sounds over and above the rustle of the ewes in
the straw, the bleat of the lambs, and the tinkle of the
sheep-bell brought me to my waking senses.&nbsp; Uncle Job was
still beside me; but he too had fallen asleep.&nbsp; I looked out
from the straw, and saw what it was that had aroused me.&nbsp;
Two men, in boat-cloaks, cocked hats, and swords, stood by the
hurdles about twenty yards off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I turned my ear thitherward to catch what they were
saying, but though I heard every word o&rsquo;t, not one did I
understand.&nbsp; They spoke in a tongue that was not
ours&mdash;in French, as I afterward found.&nbsp; But if I could
not gain the meaning of a word, I was shrewd boy enough to find
out a deal of the talkers&rsquo; business.&nbsp; By the light
o&rsquo; the moon I could see that one of &rsquo;em carried a
roll of paper in his hand, while every moment he spoke quick to
his comrade, and pointed right and left with the other hand to
spots along the shore.&nbsp; There was no doubt that he was
explaining to the second gentleman the shapes and features of the
coast.&nbsp; What happened soon after made this still clearer to
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All this time I had not waked Uncle Job, but now I
began to be afeared that they might light upon us, because uncle
breathed so heavily through&rsquo;s nose.&nbsp; I put my mouth to
his ear and whispered, &ldquo;Uncle Job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What is it, my boy?&rdquo; he said, just as if
he hadn&rsquo;t been asleep at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two French
generals&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;French?&rdquo; says he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to see
where to land their army!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I pointed &rsquo;em out; but I could say no more, for
the pair were coming at that moment much nearer to where we
lay.&nbsp; As soon as they got as near as eight or ten yards, the
officer with a roll in his hand stooped down to a slanting
hurdle, unfastened his roll upon it, and spread it out.&nbsp;
Then suddenly he sprung a dark lantern open on the paper, and
showed it to be a map.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What be they looking at?&rdquo; I whispered to
Uncle Job.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A chart of the Channel,&rdquo; says the sergeant
(knowing about such things).</p>
<p>&lsquo;The other French officer now stooped likewise, and over
the map they had a long consultation, as they pointed here and
there on the paper, and then hither and thither at places along
the shore beneath us.&nbsp; I noticed that the manner of one
officer was very respectful toward the other, who seemed much his
superior, the second in rank calling him by a sort of title that
I did not know the sense of.&nbsp; The head one, on the other
hand, was quite familiar with his friend, and more than once
clapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle Job had watched as well as I, but though the map
had been in the lantern-light, their faces had always been in
shade.&nbsp; But when they rose from stooping over the chart the
light flashed upward, and fell smart upon one of
&rsquo;em&rsquo;s features.&nbsp; No sooner had this happened
than Uncle Job gasped, and sank down as if he&rsquo;d been in a
fit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What is it&mdash;what is it, Uncle Job?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O good God!&rdquo; says he, under the straw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; says I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Boney!&rdquo; he groaned out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; says I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Bonaparty,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Corsican ogre.&nbsp; O that I had got but my new-flinted
firelock, that there man should die!&nbsp; But I haven&rsquo;t
got my new-flinted firelock, and that there man must live.&nbsp;
So lie low, as you value your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did lie low, as you mid suppose.&nbsp; But I
couldn&rsquo;t help peeping.&nbsp; And then I too, lad as I was,
knew that it was the face of Bonaparte.&nbsp; Not know
Boney?&nbsp; I should think I did know Boney.&nbsp; I should have
known him by half the light o&rsquo; that lantern.&nbsp; If I had
seen a picture of his features once, I had seen it a hundred
times.&nbsp; There was his bullet head, his short neck, his round
yaller cheeks and chin, his gloomy face, and his great glowing
eyes.&nbsp; He took off his hat to blow himself a bit, and there
was the forelock in the middle of his forehead, as in all the
draughts of him.&nbsp; In moving, his cloak fell a little open,
and I could see for a moment his white-fronted jacket and one of
his epaulets.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But none of this lasted long.&nbsp; In a minute he and
his general had rolled up the map, shut the lantern, and turned
to go down toward the shore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then Uncle Job came to himself a bit.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Slipped across in the night-time to see how to put his men
ashore,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The like o&rsquo; that
man&rsquo;s coolness eyes will never again see!&nbsp; Nephew, I
must act in this, and immediate, or England&rsquo;s
lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When they were over the brow, we crope out, and went
some little way to look after them.&nbsp; Half-way down they were
joined by two others, and six or seven minutes brought them to
the shore.&nbsp; Then, from behind a rock, a boat came out into
the weak moonlight of the Cove, and they jumped in; it put off
instantly, and vanished in a few minutes between the two rocks
that stand at the mouth of the Cove as we all know.&nbsp; We
climmed back to where we had been before, and I could see, a
little way out, a larger vessel, though still not very
large.&nbsp; The little boat drew up alongside, was made fast at
the stern as I suppose, for the largest sailed away, and we saw
no more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My uncle Job told his officers as soon as he got back
to camp; but what they thought of it I never heard&mdash;neither
did he.&nbsp; Boney&rsquo;s army never came, and a good job for
me; for the Cove below my father&rsquo;s house was where he meant
to land, as this secret visit showed.&nbsp; We coast-folk should
have been cut down one and all, and I should not have sat here to
tell this tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We who listened to old Selby that night have been familiar
with his simple grave-stone for these ten years past.&nbsp;
Thanks to the incredulity of the age his tale has been seldom
repeated.&nbsp; But if anything short of the direct testimony of
his own eyes could persuade an auditor that Bonaparte had
examined these shores for himself with a view to a practicable
landing-place, it would have been Solomon Selby&rsquo;s manner of
narrating the adventure which befell him on the down.</p>
<p><i>Christmas</i> 1882.</p>
<h2>A FEW CRUSTED CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>It is a Saturday afternoon of blue and yellow autumn time, and
the scene is the High Street of a well-known market-town.&nbsp; A
large carrier&rsquo;s van stands in the quadrangular fore-court
of the White Hart Inn, upon the sides of its spacious tilt being
painted, in weather-beaten letters: &lsquo;Burthen, Carrier to
Longpuddle.&rsquo;&nbsp; These vans, so numerous hereabout, are a
respectable, if somewhat lumbering, class of conveyance, much
resorted to by decent travellers not overstocked with money, the
better among them roughly corresponding to the old French
<i>diligences</i>.</p>
<p>The present one is timed to leave the town at four in the
afternoon precisely, and it is now half-past three by the clock
in the turret at the top of the street.&nbsp; In a few seconds
errand-boys from the shops begin to arrive with packages, which
they fling into the vehicle, and turn away whistling, and care
for the packages no more.&nbsp; At twenty minutes to four an
elderly woman places her basket upon the shafts, slowly mounts,
takes up a seat inside, and folds her hands and her lips.&nbsp;
She has secured her corner for the journey, though there is as
yet no sign of a horse being put in, nor of a carrier.&nbsp; At
the three-quarters, two other women arrive, in whom the first
recognizes the postmistress of Upper Longpuddle and the
registrar&rsquo;s wife, they recognizing her as the aged
groceress of the same village.&nbsp; At five minutes to the hour
there approach Mr. Profitt, the schoolmaster, in a soft felt hat,
and Christopher Twink, the master-thatcher; and as the hour
strikes there rapidly drop in the parish clerk and his wife, the
seedsman and his aged father, the registrar; also Mr. Day, the
world-ignored local landscape-painter, an elderly man who resides
in his native place, and has never sold a picture outside it,
though his pretensions to art have been nobly supported by his
fellow-villagers, whose confidence in his genius has been as
remarkable as the outer neglect of it, leading them to buy his
paintings so extensively (at the price of a few shillings each,
it is true) that every dwelling in the parish exhibits three or
four of those admired productions on its walls.</p>
<p>Burthen, the carrier, is by this time seen bustling round the
vehicle; the horses are put in, the proprietor arranges the reins
and springs up into his seat as if he were used to it&mdash;which
he is.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is everybody here?&rsquo; he asks preparatorily over
his shoulder to the passengers within.</p>
<p>As those who were not there did not reply in the negative the
muster was assumed to be complete, and after a few hitches and
hindrances the van with its human freight was got under
way.&nbsp; It jogged on at an easy pace till it reached the
bridge which formed the last outpost of the town.&nbsp; The
carrier pulled up suddenly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless my soul!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve forgot
the curate!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All who could do so gazed from the little back window of the
van, but the curate was not in sight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I wonder where that there man is?&rsquo; continued
the carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor man, he ought to have a living at his time of
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he ought to be punctual,&rsquo; said the
carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;Four o&rsquo;clock sharp is my time
for starting,&rdquo; I said to &rsquo;en.&nbsp; And he said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now he&rsquo;s not here,
and as a serious old church-minister he ought to be as good as
his word.&nbsp; Perhaps Mr. Flaxton knows, being in the same line
of life?&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned to the parish clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was talking an immense deal with him, that&rsquo;s
true, half an hour ago,&rsquo; replied that ecclesiastic, as one
of whom it was no erroneous supposition that he should be on
intimate terms with another of the cloth.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he
didn&rsquo;t say he would be late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The discussion was cut off by the appearance round the corner
of the van of rays from the curate&rsquo;s spectacles, followed
hastily by his face and a few white whiskers, and the swinging
tails of his long gaunt coat.&nbsp; Nobody reproached him, seeing
how he was reproaching himself; and he entered breathlessly and
took his seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now be we all here?&rsquo; said the carrier
again.&nbsp; They started a second time, and moved on till they
were about three hundred yards out of the town, and had nearly
reached the second bridge, behind which, as every native
remembers, the road takes a turn and travellers by this highway
disappear finally from the view of gazing burghers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, as I&rsquo;m alive!&rsquo; cried the postmistress
from the interior of the conveyance, peering through the little
square back-window along the road townward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said the carrier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man hailing us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another sudden stoppage.&nbsp; &lsquo;Somebody else?&rsquo;
the carrier asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, sure!&rsquo;&nbsp; All waited silently, while those
who could gaze out did so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, who can that be?&rsquo; Burthen continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I just put it to ye, neighbours, can any man keep time
with such hindrances?&nbsp; Bain&rsquo;t we full
a&rsquo;ready?&nbsp; Who in the world can the man be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a sort of gentleman,&rsquo; said the
schoolmaster, his position commanding the road more comfortably
than that of his comrades.</p>
<p>The stranger, who had been holding up his umbrella to attract
their notice, was walking forward leisurely enough, now that he
found, by their stopping, that it had been secured.&nbsp; His
clothes were decidedly not of a local cut, though it was
difficult to point out any particular mark of difference.&nbsp;
In his left hand he carried a small leather travelling bag.&nbsp;
As soon as he had overtaken the van he glanced at the inscription
on its side, as if to assure himself that he had hailed the right
conveyance, and asked if they had room.</p>
<p>The carrier replied that though they were pretty well laden he
supposed they could carry one more, whereupon the stranger
mounted, and took the seat cleared for him within.&nbsp; And then
the horses made another move, this time for good, and swung along
with their burden of fourteen souls all told.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You bain&rsquo;t one of these parts, sir?&rsquo; said
the carrier.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could tell that as far as I could see
&rsquo;ee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am one of these parts,&rsquo; said the
stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh?&nbsp; H&rsquo;m.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The silence which followed seemed to imply a doubt of the
truth of the new-comer&rsquo;s assertion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was
speaking of Upper Longpuddle more particular,&rsquo; continued
the carrier hardily, &lsquo;and I think I know most faces of that
valley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was born at Longpuddle, and nursed at Longpuddle, and
my father and grandfather before me,&rsquo; said the passenger
quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, to be sure,&rsquo; said the aged groceress in the
background, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t John Lackland&rsquo;s
son&mdash;never&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be&mdash;he who went to
foreign parts five-and-thirty years ago with his wife and
family?&nbsp; Yet&mdash;what do I hear?&mdash;that&rsquo;s his
father&rsquo;s voice!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the man,&rsquo; replied the
stranger.&nbsp; &lsquo;John Lackland was my father, and I am John
Lackland&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Five-and-thirty years ago, when I was
a boy of eleven, my parents emigrated across the seas, taking me
and my sister with them.&nbsp; Kytes&rsquo;s boy Tony was the one
who drove us and our belongings to Casterbridge on the morning we
left; and his was the last Longpuddle face I saw.&nbsp; We sailed
the same week across the ocean, and there we&rsquo;ve been ever
since, and there I&rsquo;ve left those I went with&mdash;all
three.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alive or dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead,&rsquo; he replied in a low voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I have come back to the old place, having nourished a
thought&mdash;not a definite intention, but just a
thought&mdash;that I should like to return here in a year or two,
to spend the remainder of my days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married man, Mr. Lackland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have the world used &rsquo;ee well, sir&mdash;or
rather John, knowing &rsquo;ee as a child?&nbsp; In these rich
new countries that we hear of so much, you&rsquo;ve got rich with
the rest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not very rich,&rsquo; Mr. Lackland said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Even in new countries, you know, there are failures.&nbsp;
The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong; and even if it sometimes is, you may be neither swift nor
strong.&nbsp; However, that&rsquo;s enough about me.&nbsp; Now,
having answered your inquiries, you must answer mine; for being
in London, I have come down here entirely to discover what
Longpuddle is looking like, and who are living there.&nbsp; That
was why I preferred a seat in your van to hiring a carriage for
driving across.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, as for Longpuddle, we rub on there much as
usual.&nbsp; Old figures have dropped out o&rsquo; their frames,
so to speak it, and new ones have been put in their places.&nbsp;
You mentioned Tony Kytes as having been the one to drive your
family and your goods to Casterbridge in his father&rsquo;s
waggon when you left.&nbsp; Tony is, I believe, living still, but
not at Longpuddle.&nbsp; He went away and settled at Lewgate,
near Mellstock, after his marriage.&nbsp; Ah, Tony was a sort
o&rsquo; man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His character had hardly come out when I knew
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas well enough, as far as that
goes&mdash;except as to women.&nbsp; I shall never forget his
courting&mdash;never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The returned villager waited silently, and the carrier went
on:&mdash;</p>
<h3>TONY KYTES, THE ARCH-DECEIVER</h3>
<p>&lsquo;I shall never forget Tony&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas a little, round, firm, tight face, with a seam here
and there left by the smallpox, but not enough to hurt his looks
in a woman&rsquo;s eye, though he&rsquo;d had it badish when he
was a boy.&nbsp; So very serious looking and unsmiling &rsquo;a
was, that young man, that it really seemed as if he
couldn&rsquo;t laugh at all without great pain to his
conscience.&nbsp; He looked very hard at a small speck in your
eye when talking to &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; And there was no more sign
of a whisker or beard on Tony Kytes&rsquo;s face than on the palm
of my hand.&nbsp; He used to sing &ldquo;The Tailor&rsquo;s
Breeches&rdquo; with a religious manner, as if it were a
hymn:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O the petticoats went off, and the
breeches they went on!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and all the rest of the scandalous stuff.&nbsp; He was quite
the women&rsquo;s favourite, and in return for their likings he
loved &rsquo;em in shoals.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But in course of time Tony got fixed down to one in
particular, Milly Richards, a nice, light, small, tender little
thing; and it was soon said that they were engaged to be
married.&nbsp; One Saturday he had been to market to do business
for his father, and was driving home the waggon in the
afternoon.&nbsp; When he reached the foot of the very hill we
shall be going over in ten minutes who should he see waiting for
him at the top but Unity Sallet, a handsome girl, one of the
young women he&rsquo;d been very tender toward before he&rsquo;d
got engaged to Milly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As soon as Tony came up to her she said, &ldquo;My dear
Tony, will you give me a lift home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That I will, darling,&rdquo; said Tony.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I could refuse
&rsquo;ee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She smiled a smile, and up she hopped, and on drove
Tony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo; she says, in a sort of tender
chide, &ldquo;why did ye desert me for that other one?&nbsp; In
what is she better than I?&nbsp; I should have made &rsquo;ee a
finer wife, and a more loving one too.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t
girls that are so easily won at first that are the best.&nbsp;
Think how long we&rsquo;ve known each other&mdash;ever since we
were children almost&mdash;now haven&rsquo;t we, Tony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, that we have,&rdquo; says Tony, a-struck
with the truth o&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve never seen anything in me to
complain of, have ye, Tony?&nbsp; Now tell the truth to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I never have, upon my life,&rdquo; says
Tony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And&mdash;can you say I&rsquo;m not pretty,
Tony?&nbsp; Now look at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He let his eyes light upon her for a long while.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
fact, I never knowed you was so pretty before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Prettier than she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What Tony would have said to that nobody knows, for
before he could speak, what should he see ahead, over the hedge
past the turning, but a feather he knew well&mdash;the feather in
Milly&rsquo;s hat&mdash;she to whom he had been thinking of
putting the question as to giving out the banns that very
week.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Unity,&rdquo; says he, as mild as he could,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s Milly coming.&nbsp; Now I shall catch it
mightily if she sees &rsquo;ee riding here with me; and if you
get down she&rsquo;ll be turning the corner in a moment, and,
seeing &rsquo;ee in the road, she&rsquo;ll know we&rsquo;ve been
coming on together.&nbsp; Now, dearest Unity, will ye, to avoid
all unpleasantness, which I know ye can&rsquo;t bear any more
than I, will ye lie down in the back part of the waggon, and let
me cover you over with the tarpaulin till Milly has passed?&nbsp;
It will all be done in a minute.&nbsp; Do!&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll
think over what we&rsquo;ve said; and perhaps I shall put a
loving question to you after all, instead of to Milly.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t true that it is all settled between her and
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Unity Sallet agreed, and lay down at the back end
of the waggon, and Tony covered her over, so that the waggon
seemed to be empty but for the loose tarpaulin; and then he drove
on to meet Milly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My dear Tony!&rdquo; cries Milly, looking up
with a little pout at him as he came near.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long
you&rsquo;ve been coming home!&nbsp; Just as if I didn&rsquo;t
live at Upper Longpuddle at all!&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve come to
meet you as you asked me to do, and to ride back with you, and
talk over our future home&mdash;since you asked me, and I
promised.&nbsp; But I shouldn&rsquo;t have come else, Mr.
Tony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ay, my dear, I did ask ye&mdash;to be sure I
did, now I think of it&mdash;but I had quite forgot it.&nbsp; To
ride back with me, did you say, dear Milly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, of course!&nbsp; What can I do else?&nbsp;
Surely you don&rsquo;t want me to walk, now I&rsquo;ve come all
this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O no, no!&nbsp; I was thinking you might be
going on to town to meet your mother.&nbsp; I saw her
there&mdash;and she looked as if she might be expecting
&rsquo;ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O no; she&rsquo;s just home.&nbsp; She came
across the fields, and so got back before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; says
Tony.&nbsp; And there was no help for it but to take her up
beside him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They talked on very pleasantly, and looked at the
trees, and beasts, and birds, and insects, and at the ploughmen
at work in the fields, till presently who should they see looking
out of the upper window of a house that stood beside the road
they were following, but Hannah Jolliver, another young beauty of
the place at that time, and the very first woman that Tony had
fallen in love with&mdash;before Milly and before Unity, in
fact&mdash;the one that he had almost arranged to marry instead
of Milly.&nbsp; She was a much more dashing girl than Milly
Richards, though he&rsquo;d not thought much of her of
late.&nbsp; The house Hannah was looking from was her
aunt&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My dear Milly&mdash;my coming wife, as I may
call &rsquo;ee,&rdquo; says Tony in his modest way, and not so
loud that Unity could overhear, &ldquo;I see a young woman
alooking out of window, who I think may accost me.&nbsp; The fact
is, Milly, she had a notion that I was wishing to marry her, and
since she&rsquo;s discovered I&rsquo;ve promised another, and a
prettier than she, I&rsquo;m rather afeard of her temper if she
sees us together.&nbsp; Now, Milly, would you do me a
favour&mdash;my coming wife, as I may say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly, dearest Tony,&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Then would ye creep under the empty sacks just
here in the front of the waggon, and hide there out of sight till
we&rsquo;ve passed the house?&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t seen us
yet.&nbsp; You see, we ought to live in peace and good-will since
&rsquo;tis almost Christmas, and &rsquo;twill prevent angry
passions rising, which we always should do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind, to oblige you, Tony,&rdquo;
Milly said; and though she didn&rsquo;t care much about doing it,
she crept under, and crouched down just behind the seat, Unity
being snug at the other end.&nbsp; So they drove on till they got
near the road-side cottage.&nbsp; Hannah had soon seen him
coming, and waited at the window, looking down upon him.&nbsp;
She tossed her head a little disdainful and smiled off-hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, aren&rsquo;t you going to be civil enough
to ask me to ride home with you!&rdquo; she says, seeing that he
was for driving past with a nod and a smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah, to be sure!&nbsp; What was I thinking
of?&rdquo; said Tony, in a flutter.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you seem as
if you was staying at your aunt&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I have my bonnet and jacket on?&nbsp;
I have only called to see her on my way home.&nbsp; How can you
be so stupid, Tony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;In that case&mdash;ah&mdash;of course you must
come along wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; says Tony, feeling a dim sort of
sweat rising up inside his clothes.&nbsp; And he reined in the
horse, and waited till she&rsquo;d come downstairs, and then
helped her up beside him.&nbsp; He drove on again, his face as
long as a face that was a round one by nature well could be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hannah looked round sideways into his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is nice, isn&rsquo;t it, Tony?&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I like riding with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tony looked back into her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I with
you,&rdquo; he said after a while.&nbsp; In short, having
considered her, he warmed up, and the more he looked at her the
more he liked her, till he couldn&rsquo;t for the life of him
think why he had ever said a word about marriage to Milly or
Unity while Hannah Jolliver was in question.&nbsp; So they sat a
little closer and closer, their feet upon the foot-board and
their shoulders touching, and Tony thought over and over again
how handsome Hannah was.&nbsp; He spoke tenderer and tenderer,
and called her &ldquo;dear Hannah&rdquo; in a whisper at
last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve settled it with Milly by this time,
I suppose,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;N-no, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What?&nbsp; How low you talk, Tony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ve a kind of hoarseness.&nbsp;
I said, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I suppose you mean to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, as to that&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; His eyes
rested on her face, and hers on his.&nbsp; He wondered how he
could have been such a fool as not to follow up Hannah.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My sweet Hannah!&rdquo; he bursts out, taking her hand,
not being really able to help it, and forgetting Milly and Unity,
and all the world besides.&nbsp; &ldquo;Settled it?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think I have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; says Hannah.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; says Tony, letting go her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Surely I heard a sort of little screaming squeak
under those sacks?&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;ve been carrying corn,
and there&rsquo;s mice in this waggon, I declare!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She began to haul up the tails of her gown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh no; &rsquo;tis the axle,&rdquo; said Tony in
an assuring way.&nbsp; &ldquo;It do go like that sometimes in dry
weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Perhaps it was . . . Well, now, to be quite
honest, dear Tony, do you like her better than me?&nbsp;
Because&mdash;because, although I&rsquo;ve held off so
independent, I&rsquo;ll own at last that I do like &rsquo;ee,
Tony, to tell the truth; and I wouldn&rsquo;t say no if you asked
me&mdash;you know what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tony was so won over by this pretty offering mood of a
girl who had been quite the reverse (Hannah had a backward way
with her at times, if you can mind) that he just glanced behind,
and then whispered very soft, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t quite
promised her, and I think I can get out of it, and ask you that
question you speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Throw over Milly?&mdash;all to marry me!&nbsp;
How delightful!&rdquo; broke out Hannah, quite loud, clapping her
hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At this there was a real squeak&mdash;an angry,
spiteful squeak, and afterward a long moan, as if something had
broke its heart, and a movement of the empty sacks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s there!&rdquo; said Hannah,
starting up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, really,&rdquo; says Tony in
a soothing voice, and praying inwardly for a way out of
this.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;ee at first,
because I wouldn&rsquo;t frighten &rsquo;ee.&nbsp; But, Hannah,
I&rsquo;ve really a couple of ferrets in a bag under there, for
rabbiting, and they quarrel sometimes.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish
it knowed, as &rsquo;twould be called poaching.&nbsp; Oh, they
can&rsquo;t get out, bless ye&mdash;you are quite safe!&nbsp;
And&mdash;and&mdash;what a fine day it is, isn&rsquo;t it,
Hannah, for this time of year?&nbsp; Be you going to market next
Saturday?&nbsp; How is your aunt now?&rdquo;&nbsp; And so on,
says Tony, to keep her from talking any more about love in
Milly&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he found his work cut out for him, and wondering
again how he should get out of this ticklish business, he looked
about for a chance.&nbsp; Nearing home he saw his father in a
field not far off, holding up his hand as if he wished to speak
to Tony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Would you mind taking the reins a moment,
Hannah,&rdquo; he said, much relieved, &ldquo;while I go and find
out what father wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She consented, and away he hastened into the field,
only too glad to get breathing time.&nbsp; He found that his
father was looking at him with rather a stern eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Come, come, Tony,&rdquo; says old Mr. Kytes, as
soon as his son was alongside him, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; says Tony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, if you mean to marry Milly Richards, do it,
and there&rsquo;s an end o&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t go
driving about the country with Jolliver&rsquo;s daughter and
making a scandal.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t have such things
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I only asked her&mdash;that is, she asked me, to
ride home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She?&nbsp; Why, now, if it had been Milly,
&rsquo;twould have been quite proper; but you and Hannah Jolliver
going about by yourselves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Milly&rsquo;s there too, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Milly?&nbsp; Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Under the corn-sacks!&nbsp; Yes, the truth is,
father, I&rsquo;ve got rather into a nunny-watch, I&rsquo;m
afeard!&nbsp; Unity Sallet is there too&mdash;yes, at the other
end, under the tarpaulin.&nbsp; All three are in that waggon, and
what to do with &rsquo;em I know no more than the dead!&nbsp; The
best plan is, as I&rsquo;m thinking, to speak out loud and plain
to one of &rsquo;em before the rest, and that will settle it; not
but what &rsquo;twill cause &rsquo;em to kick up a bit of a miff,
for certain.&nbsp; Now which would you marry, father, if you was
in my place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Whichever of &rsquo;em did <i>not</i> ask to
ride with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That was Milly, I&rsquo;m bound to say, as she
only mounted by my invitation.&nbsp; But Milly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then stick to Milly, she&rsquo;s the best . . . But
look at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His father pointed toward the waggon.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
can&rsquo;t hold that horse in.&nbsp; You shouldn&rsquo;t have
left the reins in her hands.&nbsp; Run on and take the
horse&rsquo;s head, or there&rsquo;ll be some accident to them
maids!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tony&rsquo;s horse, in fact, in spite of Hannah&rsquo;s
tugging at the reins, had started on his way at a brisk walking
pace, being very anxious to get back to the stable, for he had
had a long day out.&nbsp; Without another word Tony rushed away
from his father to overtake the horse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now of all things that could have happened to wean him
from Milly there was nothing so powerful as his father&rsquo;s
recommending her.&nbsp; No; it could not be Milly, after
all.&nbsp; Hannah must be the one, since he could not marry all
three.&nbsp; This he thought while running after the
waggon.&nbsp; But queer things were happening inside it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was, of course, Milly who had screamed under the
sack-bags, being obliged to let off her bitter rage and shame in
that way at what Tony was saying, and never daring to show, for
very pride and dread o&rsquo; being laughed at, that she was in
hiding.&nbsp; She became more and more restless, and in twisting
herself about, what did she see but another woman&rsquo;s foot
and white stocking close to her head.&nbsp; It quite frightened
her, not knowing that Unity Sallet was in the waggon
likewise.&nbsp; But after the fright was over she determined to
get to the bottom of all this, and she crept and crept along the
bed of the waggon, under the tarpaulin, like a snake, when lo and
behold she came face to face with Unity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, if this isn&rsquo;t disgraceful!&rdquo;
says Milly in a raging whisper to Unity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis,&rdquo; says Unity, &ldquo;to see you
hiding in a young man&rsquo;s waggon like this, and no great
character belonging to either of ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Mind what you are saying!&rdquo; replied Milly,
getting louder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am engaged to be married to him,
and haven&rsquo;t I a right to be here?&nbsp; What right have
you, I should like to know?&nbsp; What has he been promising
you?&nbsp; A pretty lot of nonsense, I expect!&nbsp; But what
Tony says to other women is all mere wind, and no concern to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be too sure!&rdquo; says
Unity.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to have Hannah, and not you,
nor me either; I could hear that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now at these strange voices sounding from under the
cloth Hannah was thunderstruck a&rsquo;most into a swound; and it
was just at this time that the horse moved on.&nbsp; Hannah
tugged away wildly, not knowing what she was doing; and as the
quarrel rose louder and louder Hannah got so horrified that she
let go the reins altogether.&nbsp; The horse went on at his own
pace, and coming to the corner where we turn round to drop down
the hill to Lower Longpuddle he turned too quick, the off wheels
went up the bank, the waggon rose sideways till it was quite on
edge upon the near axles, and out rolled the three maidens into
the road in a heap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When Tony came up, frightened and breathless, he was
relieved enough to see that neither of his darlings was hurt,
beyond a few scratches from the brambles of the hedge.&nbsp; But
he was rather alarmed when he heard how they were going on at one
another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye quarrel, my
dears&mdash;don&rsquo;t ye!&rdquo; says he, taking off his hat
out of respect to &rsquo;em.&nbsp; And then he would have kissed
them all round, as fair and square as a man could, but they were
in too much of a taking to let him, and screeched and sobbed till
they was quite spent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll speak out honest, because I ought
to,&rdquo; says Tony, as soon as he could get heard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And this is the truth,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked Hannah to be mine, and she is willing,
and we are going to put up the banns next&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tony had not noticed that Hannah&rsquo;s father was
coming up behind, nor had he noticed that Hannah&rsquo;s face was
beginning to bleed from the scratch of a bramble.&nbsp; Hannah
had seen her father, and had run to him, crying worse than
ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My daughter is <i>not</i> willing, sir!&rdquo;
says Mr. Jolliver hot and strong.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be you willing,
Hannah?&nbsp; I ask ye to have spirit enough to refuse him, if
yer virtue is left to &rsquo;ee and you run no risk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as sound as a bell for me, that
I&rsquo;ll swear!&rdquo; says Tony, flaring up.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
so&rsquo;s the others, come to that, though you may think it an
onusual thing in me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I have spirit, and I do refuse him!&rdquo; says
Hannah, partly because her father was there, and partly, too, in
a tantrum because of the discovery, and the scratch on her
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Little did I think when I was so soft with him
just now that I was talking to such a false deceiver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What, you won&rsquo;t have me, Hannah?&rdquo;
says Tony, his jaw hanging down like a dead man&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Never&mdash;I would sooner marry no&mdash;nobody
at all!&rdquo; she gasped out, though with her heart in her
throat, for she would not have refused Tony if he had asked her
quietly, and her father had not been there, and her face had not
been scratched by the bramble.&nbsp; And having said that, away
she walked upon her father&rsquo;s arm, thinking and hoping he
would ask her again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tony didn&rsquo;t know what to say next.&nbsp; Milly
was sobbing her heart out; but as his father had strongly
recommended her he couldn&rsquo;t feel inclined that way.&nbsp;
So he turned to Unity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, will you, Unity dear, be mine?&rdquo; he
says.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Take her leavings?&nbsp; Not I!&rdquo; says
Unity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d scorn it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And away
walks Unity Sallet likewise, though she looked back when
she&rsquo;d gone some way, to see if he was following her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So there at last were left Milly and Tony by
themselves, she crying in watery streams, and Tony looking like a
tree struck by lightning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, Milly,&rdquo; he says at last, going up to
her, &ldquo;it do seem as if fate had ordained that it should be
you and I, or nobody.&nbsp; And what must be must be, I
suppose.&nbsp; Hey, Milly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If you like, Tony.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t really
mean what you said to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not a word of it!&rdquo; declares Tony, bringing
down his fist upon his palm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then he kissed her, and put the waggon to rights,
and they mounted together; and their banns were put up the very
next Sunday.&nbsp; I was not able to go to their wedding, but it
was a rare party they had, by all account.&nbsp; Everybody in
Longpuddle was there almost; you among the rest, I think, Mr.
Flaxton?&rsquo;&nbsp; The speaker turned to the parish clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was,&rsquo; said Mr. Flaxton.&nbsp; &lsquo;And that
party was the cause of a very curious change in some other
people&rsquo;s affairs; I mean in Steve Hardcome&rsquo;s and his
cousin James&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! the Hardcomes,&rsquo; said the stranger.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How familiar that name is to me!&nbsp; What of
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clerk cleared his throat and began:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE HISTORY OF THE HARDCOMES</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Tony&rsquo;s was the very best wedding-randy that
ever I was at; and I&rsquo;ve been at a good many, as you may
suppose&rsquo;&mdash;turning to the newly-arrived
one&mdash;&lsquo;having as a church-officer, the privilege to
attend all christening, wedding, and funeral parties&mdash;such
being our Wessex custom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas on a frosty night in Christmas week, and
among the folk invited were the said Hardcomes o&rsquo;
Climmerston&mdash;Steve and James&mdash;first cousins, both of
them small farmers, just entering into business on their own
account.&nbsp; With them came, as a matter of course, their
intended wives, two young women of the neighbourhood, both very
pretty and sprightly maidens, and numbers of friends from
Abbot&rsquo;s-Cernel, and Weatherbury, and Mellstock, and I
don&rsquo;t know where&mdash;a regular houseful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The kitchen was cleared of furniture for dancing, and
the old folk played at &ldquo;Put&rdquo; and
&ldquo;All-fours&rdquo; in the parlour, though at last they gave
that up to join in the dance.&nbsp; The top of the figure was by
the large front window of the room, and there were so many
couples that the lower part of the figure reached through the
door at the back, and into the darkness of the out-house; in
fact, you couldn&rsquo;t see the end of the row at all, and
&rsquo;twas never known exactly how long that dance was, the
lowest couples being lost among the faggots and brushwood in the
out-house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we had danced a few hours, and the crowns of we
taller men were swelling into lumps with bumping the beams of the
ceiling, the first fiddler laid down his fiddle-bow, and said he
should play no more, for he wished to dance.&nbsp; And in another
hour the second fiddler laid down his, and said he wanted to
dance too; so there was only the third fiddler left, and he was
a&rsquo; old, veteran man, very weak in the wrist.&nbsp; However,
he managed to keep up a faltering tweedle-dee; but there being no
chair in the room, and his knees being as weak as his wrists, he
was obliged to sit upon as much of the little corner-table as
projected beyond the corner-cupboard fixed over it, which was not
a very wide seat for a man advanced in years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among those who danced most continually were the two
engaged couples, as was natural to their situation.&nbsp; Each
pair was very well matched, and very unlike the other.&nbsp;
James Hardcome&rsquo;s intended was called Emily Darth, and both
she and James were gentle, nice-minded, in-door people, fond of a
quiet life.&nbsp; Steve and his chosen, named Olive Pawle, were
different; they were of a more bustling nature, fond of racketing
about and seeing what was going on in the world.&nbsp; The two
couples had arranged to get married on the same day, and that not
long thence; Tony&rsquo;s wedding being a sort of stimulant, as
is often the case; I&rsquo;ve noticed it professionally many
times.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They danced with such a will as only young people in
that stage of courtship can dance; and it happened that as the
evening wore on James had for his partner Stephen&rsquo;s
plighted one, Olive, at the same time that Stephen was dancing
with James&rsquo;s Emily.&nbsp; It was noticed that in spite
o&rsquo; the exchange the young men seemed to enjoy the dance no
less than before.&nbsp; By and by they were treading another tune
in the same changed order as we had noticed earlier, and though
at first each one had held the other&rsquo;s mistress strictly at
half-arm&rsquo;s length, lest there should be shown any objection
to too close quarters by the lady&rsquo;s proper man, as time
passed there was a little more closeness between &rsquo;em; and
presently a little more closeness still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The later it got the more did each of the two cousins
dance with the wrong young girl, and the tighter did he hold her
to his side as he whirled her round; and, what was very
remarkable, neither seemed to mind what the other was
doing.&nbsp; The party began to draw towards its end, and I saw
no more that night, being one of the first to leave, on account
of my morning&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; But I learnt the rest of it
from those that knew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After finishing a particularly warming dance with the
changed partners, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned, the two young men
looked at one another, and in a moment or two went out into the
porch together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;James,&rdquo; says Steve, &ldquo;what were you
thinking of when you were dancing with my Olive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said James, &ldquo;perhaps what you
were thinking of when you were dancing with my Emily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Steve, with some
hesitation, &ldquo;that I wouldn&rsquo;t mind changing for good
and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It was what I was feeling likewise,&rdquo; said
James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I willingly agree to it, if you think we could
manage it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;So do I.&nbsp; But what would the girls
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my belief,&rdquo; said Steve,
&ldquo;that they wouldn&rsquo;t particularly object.&nbsp; Your
Emily clung as close to me as if she already belonged to me, dear
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And your Olive to me,&rdquo; says James.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could feel her heart beating like a clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, they agreed to put it to the girls when they were
all four walking home together.&nbsp; And they did so.&nbsp; When
they parted that night the exchange was decided on&mdash;all
having been done under the hot excitement of that evening&rsquo;s
dancing.&nbsp; Thus it happened that on the following Sunday
morning, when the people were sitting in church with mouths wide
open to hear the names published as they had expected, there was
no small amazement to hear them coupled the wrong way, as it
seemed.&nbsp; The congregation whispered, and thought the parson
had made a mistake; till they discovered that his reading of the
names was verily the true way.&nbsp; As they had decided, so they
were married, each one to the other&rsquo;s original
property.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the two couples lived on for a year or two
ordinarily enough, till the time came when these young people
began to grow a little less warm to their respective spouses, as
is the rule of married life; and the two cousins wondered more
and more in their hearts what had made &rsquo;em so mad at the
last moment to marry crosswise as they did, when they might have
married straight, as was planned by nature, and as they had
fallen in love.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas Tony&rsquo;s party that had
done <i>it</i>, plain enough, and they half wished they had never
gone there.&nbsp; James, being a quiet, fireside, perusing man,
felt at times a wide gap between himself and Olive, his wife, who
loved riding and driving and out-door jaunts to a degree;
while Steve, who was always knocking about hither and thither,
had a very domestic wife, who worked samplers, and made
hearthrugs, scarcely ever wished to cross the threshold, and only
drove out with him to please him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, they said very little about this mismating to
any of their acquaintances, though sometimes Steve would look at
James&rsquo;s wife and sigh, and James would look at
Steve&rsquo;s wife and do the same.&nbsp; Indeed, at last the two
men were frank enough towards each other not to mind mentioning
it quietly to themselves, in a long-faced, sorry-smiling,
whimsical sort of way, and would shake their heads together over
their foolishness in upsetting a well-considered choice on the
strength of an hour&rsquo;s fancy in the whirl and wildness of a
dance.&nbsp; Still, they were sensible and honest young fellows
enough, and did their best to make shift with their lot as they
had arranged it, and not to repine at what could not now be
altered or mended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So things remained till one fine summer day they went
for their yearly little outing together, as they had made it
their custom to do for a long while past.&nbsp; This year they
chose Budmouth-Regis as the place to spend their holiday in; and
off they went in their best clothes at nine o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When they had reached Budmouth-Regis they walked two
and two along the shore&mdash;their new boots going
squeakity-squash upon the clammy velvet sands.&nbsp; I can seem
to see &rsquo;em now!&nbsp; Then they looked at the ships in the
harbour; and then went up to the Look-out; and then had dinner at
an inn; and then again walked two and two, squeakity-squash, upon
the velvet sands.&nbsp; As evening drew on they sat on one of the
public seats upon the Esplanade, and listened to the band; and
then they said &ldquo;What shall we do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Of all things,&rdquo; said Olive (Mrs. James
Hardcome, that is), &ldquo;I should like to row in the bay!&nbsp;
We could listen to the music from the water as well as from here,
and have the fun of rowing besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The very thing; so should I,&rdquo; says
Stephen, his tastes being always like hers.</p>
<p>Here the clerk turned to the curate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you, sir, know the rest of the strange particulars
of that strange evening of their lives better than anybody else,
having had much of it from their own lips, which I had not; and
perhaps you&rsquo;ll oblige the gentleman?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, if it is wished,&rsquo; said the
curate.&nbsp; And he took up the clerk&rsquo;s tale:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen&rsquo;s wife hated the sea, except from land,
and couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of going into a boat.&nbsp;
James, too, disliked the water, and said that for his part he
would much sooner stay on and listen to the band in the seat they
occupied, though he did not wish to stand in his wife&rsquo;s way
if she desired a row.&nbsp; The end of the discussion was that
James and his cousin&rsquo;s wife Emily agreed to remain where
they were sitting and enjoy the music, while they watched the
other two hire a boat just beneath, and take their
water-excursion of half an hour or so, till they should choose to
come back and join the sitters on the Esplanade; when they would
all start homeward together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing could have pleased the other two restless ones
better than this arrangement; and Emily and James watched them go
down to the boatman below and choose one of the little yellow
skiffs, and walk carefully out upon the little plank that was
laid on trestles to enable them to get alongside the craft.&nbsp;
They saw Stephen hand Olive in, and take his seat facing her;
when they were settled they waved their hands to the couple
watching them, and then Stephen took the pair of sculls and
pulled off to the tune beat by the band, she steering through the
other boats skimming about, for the sea was as smooth as glass
that evening, and pleasure-seekers were rowing everywhere.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How pretty they look moving on, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; said Emily to James (as I&rsquo;ve been
assured).&nbsp; &ldquo;They both enjoy it equally.&nbsp; In
everything their likings are the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They would have made a handsome pair if they had
married,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a
pity we should have parted &rsquo;em&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of that, James,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;For better or for worse we decided to do as we
did, and there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They sat on after that without speaking, side by side,
and the band played as before; the people strolled up and down;
and Stephen and Olive shrank smaller and smaller as they shot
straight out to sea.&nbsp; The two on shore used to relate how
they saw Stephen stop rowing a moment, and take off his coat to
get at his work better; but James&rsquo;s wife sat quite still in
the stern, holding the tiller-ropes by which she steered the
boat.&nbsp; When they had got very small indeed she turned her
head to shore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She is waving her handkerchief to us,&rdquo;
said Stephen&rsquo;s wife, who thereupon pulled out her own, and
waved it as a return signal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The boat&rsquo;s course had been a little awry while
Mrs. James neglected her steering to wave her handkerchief to her
husband and Mrs. Stephen; but now the light skiff went straight
onward again, and they could soon see nothing more of the two
figures it contained than Olive&rsquo;s light mantle and
Stephen&rsquo;s white shirt sleeves behind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The two on the shore talked on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas very curious&mdash;our changing partners at
Tony Kytes&rsquo;s wedding,&rdquo; Emily declared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tony was of a fickle nature by all account, and it really
seemed as if his character had infected us that night.&nbsp;
Which of you two was it that first proposed not to marry as we
were engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;H&rsquo;m&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember at this
moment,&rdquo; says James.&nbsp; &ldquo;We talked it over, you
know; and no sooner said than done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas the dancing,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;People get quite crazy sometimes in a dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; he owned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;James&mdash;do you think they care for one
another still?&rdquo; asks Mrs. Stephen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;James Hardcome mused and admitted that perhaps a little
tender feeling might flicker up in their hearts for a moment now
and then.&nbsp; &ldquo;Still, nothing of any account,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I sometimes think that Olive is in Steve&rsquo;s
mind a good deal,&rdquo; murmurs Mrs. Stephen;
&ldquo;particularly when she pleases his fancy by riding past our
window at a gallop on one of the draught-horses . . . I never
could do anything of that sort; I could never get over my fear of
a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And I am no horseman, though I pretend to be on
her account,&rdquo; murmured James Hardcome.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
isn&rsquo;t it almost time for them to turn and sweep round to
the shore, as the other boating folk have done?&nbsp; I wonder
what Olive means by steering away straight to the horizon like
that?&nbsp; She has hardly swerved from a direct line seaward
since they started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No doubt they are talking, and don&rsquo;t think
of where they are going,&rdquo; suggests Stephen&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; said James.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know Steve could row like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; says she.&nbsp; &ldquo;He often
comes here on business, and generally has a pull round the
bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I can hardly see the boat or them,&rdquo; says
James again; &ldquo;and it is getting dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The heedless pair afloat now formed a mere speck in the
films of the coming night, which thickened apace, till it
completely swallowed up their distant shapes.&nbsp; They had
disappeared while still following the same straight course away
from the world of land-livers, as if they were intending to drop
over the sea-edge into space, and never return to earth
again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The two on the shore continued to sit on, punctually
abiding by their agreement to remain on the same spot till the
others returned.&nbsp; The Esplanade lamps were lit one by one,
the bandsmen folded up their stands and departed, the yachts in
the bay hung out their riding lights, and the little boats came
back to shore one after another, their hirers walking on to the
sands by the plank they had climbed to go afloat; but among these
Stephen and Olive did not appear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What a time they are!&rdquo; said Emily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am getting quite chilly.&nbsp; I did not expect to have
to sit so long in the evening air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thereupon James Hardcome said that he did not require
his overcoat, and insisted on lending it to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He wrapped it round Emily&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Thank you, James,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How cold Olive must be in that thin jacket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He said he was thinking so too.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, they
are sure to be quite close at hand by this time, though we
can&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em.&nbsp; The boats are not all in
yet.&nbsp; Some of the rowers are fond of paddling along the
shore to finish out their hour of hiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Shall we walk by the edge of the water,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;to see if we can discover them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He assented, reminding her that they must not lose
sight of the seat, lest the belated pair should return and miss
them, and be vexed that they had not kept the appointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They walked a sentry beat up and down the sands
immediately opposite the seat; and still the others did not
come.&nbsp; James Hardcome at last went to the boatman, thinking
that after all his wife and cousin might have come in under
shadow of the dusk without being perceived, and might have
forgotten the appointment at the bench.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;All in?&rdquo; asked James.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;All but one boat,&rdquo; said the lessor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think where that couple is keeping to.&nbsp;
They might run foul of something or other in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Again Stephen&rsquo;s wife and Olive&rsquo;s husband
waited, with more and more anxiety.&nbsp; But no little yellow
boat returned.&nbsp; Was it possible they could have landed
further down the Esplanade?</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It may have been done to escape paying,&rdquo;
said the boat-owner.&nbsp; &ldquo;But they didn&rsquo;t look like
people who would do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;James Hardcome knew that he could found no hope on such
a reason as that.&nbsp; But now, remembering what had been
casually discussed between Steve and himself about their wives
from time to time, he admitted for the first time the possibility
that their old tenderness had been revived by their face-to-face
position more strongly than either had anticipated at
starting&mdash;the excursion having been so obviously undertaken
for the pleasure of the performance only,&mdash;and that they had
landed at some steps he knew of further down toward the pier, to
be longer alone together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still he disliked to harbour the thought, and would not
mention its existence to his companion.&nbsp; He merely said to
her, &ldquo;Let us walk further on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They did so, and lingered between the boat-stage and
the pier till Stephen Hardcome&rsquo;s wife was uneasy, and was
obliged to accept James&rsquo;s offered arm.&nbsp; Thus the night
advanced.&nbsp; Emily was presently so worn out by fatigue that
James felt it necessary to conduct her home; there was, too, a
remote chance that the truants had landed in the harbour on the
other side of the town, or elsewhere, and hastened home in some
unexpected way, in the belief that their consorts would not have
waited so long.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, he left a direction in the town that a lookout
should be kept, though this was arranged privately, the bare
possibility of an elopement being enough to make him reticent;
and, full of misgivings, the two remaining ones hastened to catch
the last train out of Budmouth-Regis; and when they got to
Casterbridge drove back to Upper Longpuddle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Along this very road as we do now,&rsquo; remarked the
parish clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure&mdash;along this very road,&rsquo; said the
curate.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, Stephen and Olive were not at their
homes; neither had entered the village since leaving it in the
morning.&nbsp; Emily and James Hardcome went to their respective
dwellings to snatch a hasty night&rsquo;s rest, and at daylight
the next morning they drove again to Casterbridge and entered the
Budmouth train, the line being just opened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing had been heard of the couple there during this
brief absence.&nbsp; In the course of a few hours some young men
testified to having seen such a man and woman rowing in a frail
hired craft, the head of the boat kept straight to sea; they had
sat looking in each other&rsquo;s faces as if they were in a
dream, with no consciousness of what they were doing, or whither
they were steering.&nbsp; It was not till late that day that more
tidings reached James&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; The boat had been found
drifting bottom upward a long way from land.&nbsp; In the evening
the sea rose somewhat, and a cry spread through the town that two
bodies were cast ashore in Lullstead Bay, several miles to the
eastward.&nbsp; They were brought to Budmouth, and inspection
revealed them to be the missing pair.&nbsp; It was said that they
had been found tightly locked in each other&rsquo;s arms, his
lips upon hers, their features still wrapt in the same calm and
dream-like repose which had been observed in their demeanour as
they had glided along.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither James nor Emily questioned the original motives
of the unfortunate man and woman in putting to sea.&nbsp; They
were both above suspicion as to intention.&nbsp; Whatever their
mutual feelings might have led them on to, underhand behaviour
was foreign to the nature of either.&nbsp; Conjecture pictured
that they might have fallen into tender reverie while gazing each
into a pair of eyes that had formerly flashed for him and her
alone, and, unwilling to avow what their mutual sentiments were,
they had continued thus, oblivious of time and space, till
darkness suddenly overtook them far from land.&nbsp; But nothing
was truly known.&nbsp; It had been their destiny to die
thus.&nbsp; The two halves, intended by Nature to make the
perfect whole, had failed in that result during their lives,
though &ldquo;in their death they were not divided.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Their bodies were brought home, and buried on one day.&nbsp; I
remember that, on looking round the churchyard while reading the
service, I observed nearly all the parish at their
funeral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was so, sir,&rsquo; said the clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The remaining two,&rsquo; continued the curate (whose
voice had grown husky while relating the lovers&rsquo; sad fate),
&lsquo;were a more thoughtful and far-seeing, though less
romantic, couple than the first.&nbsp; They were now mutually
bereft of a companion, and found themselves by this accident in a
position to fulfil their destiny according to Nature&rsquo;s plan
and their own original and calmly-formed intention.&nbsp; James
Hardcome took Emily to wife in the course of a year and a half;
and the marriage proved in every respect a happy one.&nbsp; I
solemnized the service, Hardcome having told me, when he came to
give notice of the proposed wedding, the story of his first
wife&rsquo;s loss almost word for word as I have told it to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are they living in Longpuddle still?&rsquo; asked
the new-comer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, sir,&rsquo; interposed the clerk.&nbsp;
&lsquo;James has been dead these dozen years, and his
mis&rsquo;ess about six or seven.&nbsp; They had no
children.&nbsp; William Privett used to be their odd man till he
died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;William Privett!&nbsp; He dead too?&mdash;dear
me!&rsquo; said the other.&nbsp; &lsquo;All passed
away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; William was much older than I.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been over eighty if he had lived till
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was something very strange about William&rsquo;s
death&mdash;very strange indeed!&rsquo; sighed a melancholy man
in the back of the van.&nbsp; It was the seedsman&rsquo;s father,
who had hitherto kept silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what might that have been?&rsquo; asked Mr.
Lackland.</p>
<h3>THE SUPERSTITIOUS MAN&rsquo;S STORY</h3>
<p>&lsquo;William, as you may know, was a curious, silent man;
you could feel when he came near &rsquo;ee; and if he was in the
house or anywhere behind your back without your seeing him, there
seemed to be something clammy in the air, as if a cellar door was
opened close by your elbow.&nbsp; Well, one Sunday, at a time
that William was in very good health to all appearance, the bell
that was ringing for church went very heavy all of a sudden; the
sexton, who told me o&rsquo;t, said he&rsquo;d not known the bell
go so heavy in his hand for years&mdash;it was just as if the
gudgeons wanted oiling.&nbsp; That was on the Sunday, as I
say.&nbsp; During the week after, it chanced that William&rsquo;s
wife was staying up late one night to finish her ironing, she
doing the washing for Mr. and Mrs. Hardcome.&nbsp; Her husband
had finished his supper and gone to bed as usual some hour or two
before.&nbsp; While she ironed she heard him coming down stairs;
he stopped to put on his boots at the stair-foot, where he always
left them, and then came on into the living-room where she was
ironing, passing through it towards the door, this being the only
way from the staircase to the outside of the house.&nbsp; No word
was said on either side, William not being a man given to much
speaking, and his wife being occupied with her work.&nbsp; He
went out and closed the door behind him.&nbsp; As her husband had
now and then gone out in this way at night before when unwell, or
unable to sleep for want of a pipe, she took no particular
notice, and continued at her ironing.&nbsp; This she finished
shortly after, and as he had not come in she waited awhile for
him, putting away the irons and things, and preparing the table
for his breakfast in the morning.&nbsp; Still he did not return,
but supposing him not far off, and wanting to get to bed herself,
tired as she was, she left the door unbarred and went to the
stairs, after writing on the back of the door with chalk: <i>Mind
and do the door</i> (because he was a forgetful man).</p>
<p>&lsquo;To her great surprise, and I might say alarm, on
reaching the foot of the stairs his boots were standing there as
they always stood when he had gone to rest; going up to their
chamber she found him in bed sleeping as sound as a rock.&nbsp;
How he could have got back again without her seeing or hearing
him was beyond her comprehension.&nbsp; It could only have been
by passing behind her very quietly while she was bumping with the
iron.&nbsp; But this notion did not satisfy her: it was surely
impossible that she should not have seen him come in through a
room so small.&nbsp; She could not unravel the mystery, and felt
very queer and uncomfortable about it.&nbsp; However, she would
not disturb him to question him then, and went to bed
herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He rose and left for his work very early the next
morning, before she was awake, and she waited his return to
breakfast with much anxiety for an explanation, for thinking over
the matter by daylight made it seem only the more
startling.&nbsp; When he came in to the meal he said, before she
could put her question, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of them
words chalked on the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She told him, and asked him about his going out the
night before.&nbsp; William declared that he had never left the
bedroom after entering it, having in fact undressed, lain down,
and fallen asleep directly, never once waking till the clock
struck five, and he rose up to go to his labour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Betty Privett was as certain in her own mind that he
did go out as she was of her own existence, and was little less
certain that he did not return.&nbsp; She felt too disturbed to
argue with him, and let the subject drop as though she must have
been mistaken.&nbsp; When she was walking down Longpuddle street
later in the day she met Jim Weedle&rsquo;s daughter Nancy, and
said, &ldquo;Well, Nancy, you do look sleepy to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Privett,&rdquo; says Nancy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t tell anybody, but I don&rsquo;t mind
letting you know what the reason o&rsquo;t is.&nbsp; Last night,
being Old Midsummer Eve, some of us went to church porch, and
didn&rsquo;t get home till near one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Did ye?&rdquo; says Mrs. Privett.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Old Midsummer yesterday was it?&nbsp; Faith I didn&rsquo;t
think whe&rsquo;r &rsquo;twas Midsummer or Michaelmas; I&rsquo;d
too much work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; And we were frightened enough, I can
tell &rsquo;ee, by what we saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What did ye see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;(You may not remember, sir, having gone off to foreign
parts so young, that on Midsummer Night it is believed hereabout
that the faint shapes of all the folk in the parish who are going
to be at death&rsquo;s door within the year can be seen entering
the church.&nbsp; Those who get over their illness come out again
after a while; those that are doomed to die do not return.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; asked William&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says Nancy,
backwardly&mdash;&ldquo;we needn&rsquo;t tell what we saw, or who
we saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You saw my husband,&rdquo; says Betty Privett,
in a quiet way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, since you put it so,&rdquo; says Nancy,
hanging fire, &ldquo;we&mdash;thought we did see him; but it was
darkish, and we was frightened, and of course it might not have
been he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Nancy, you needn&rsquo;t mind letting it out,
though &rsquo;tis kept back in kindness.&nbsp; And he
didn&rsquo;t come out of church again: I know it as well as
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nancy did not answer yes or no to that, and no more was
said.&nbsp; But three days after, William Privett was mowing with
John Chiles in Mr. Hardcome&rsquo;s meadow, and in the heat of
the day they sat down to eat their bit o&rsquo; nunch under a
tree, and empty their flagon.&nbsp; Afterwards both of &rsquo;em
fell asleep as they sat.&nbsp; John Chiles was the first to wake,
and as he looked towards his fellow-mower he saw one of those
great white miller&rsquo;s-souls as we call &rsquo;em&mdash;that
is to say, a miller-moth&mdash;come from William&rsquo;s open
mouth while he slept, and fly straight away.&nbsp; John thought
it odd enough, as William had worked in a mill for several years
when he was a boy.&nbsp; He then looked at the sun, and found by
the place o&rsquo;t that they had slept a long while, and as
William did not wake, John called to him and said it was high
time to begin work again.&nbsp; He took no notice, and then John
went up and shook him, and found he was dead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now on that very day old Philip Hookhorn was down at
Longpuddle Spring dipping up a pitcher of water; and as he turned
away, who should he see coming down to the spring on the other
side but William, looking very pale and odd.&nbsp; This surprised
Philip Hookhorn very much, for years before that time
William&rsquo;s little son&mdash;his only child&mdash;had been
drowned in that spring while at play there, and this had so
preyed upon William&rsquo;s mind that he&rsquo;d never been seen
near the spring afterwards, and had been known to go half a mile
out of his way to avoid the place.&nbsp; On inquiry, it was found
that William in body could not have stood by the spring, being in
the mead two miles off; and it also came out that the time at
which he was seen at the spring was the very time when he
died.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;A rather melancholy story,&rsquo; observed the
emigrant, after a minute&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes.&nbsp; Well, we must take ups and downs
together,&rsquo; said the seedsman&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Lackland, I suppose, what a
rum start that was between Andrey Satchel and Jane Vallens and
the pa&rsquo;son and clerk o&rsquo; Scrimpton?&rsquo; said the
master-thatcher, a man with a spark of subdued liveliness in his
eye, who had hitherto kept his attention mainly upon small
objects a long way ahead, as he sat in front of the van with his
feet outside.&nbsp; &lsquo;Theirs was a queerer experience of a
pa&rsquo;son and clerk than some folks get, and may cheer
&rsquo;ee up a little after this dampness that&rsquo;s been flung
over yer soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The returned one replied that he knew nothing of the history,
and should be happy to hear it, quite recollecting the
personality of the man Satchel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah no; this Andrey Satchel is the son of the Satchel
that you knew; this one has not been married more than two or
three years, and &rsquo;twas at the time o&rsquo; the wedding
that the accident happened that I could tell &rsquo;ee of, or
anybody else here, for that matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; you must tell it, neighbour, if anybody,&rsquo;
said several; a request in which Mr. Lackland joined, adding that
the Satchel family was one he had known well before leaving
home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just mention, as you be a stranger,&rsquo;
whispered the carrier to Lackland, &lsquo;that
Christopher&rsquo;s stories will bear pruning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The emigrant nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I can soon tell it,&rsquo; said the
master-thatcher, schooling himself to a tone of actuality.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Though as it has more to do with the pa&rsquo;son and
clerk than with Andrey himself, it ought to be told by a better
churchman than I.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>ANDREY SATCHEL AND THE PARSON AND CLERK</h3>
<p>&lsquo;It all arose, you must know, from Andrey being fond of
a drop of drink at that time&mdash;though he&rsquo;s a sober
enough man now by all account, so much the better for him.&nbsp;
Jane, his bride, you see, was somewhat older than Andrey; how
much older I don&rsquo;t pretend to say; she was not one of our
parish, and the register alone may be able to tell that.&nbsp;
But, at any rate, her being a little ahead of her young man in
mortal years, coupled with other bodily
circumstances&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Ah, poor thing!&rsquo; sighed the women.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;made her very anxious to get the thing done
before he changed his mind; and &rsquo;twas with a joyful
countenance (they say) that she, with Andrey and his brother and
sister-in-law, marched off to church one November morning as soon
as &rsquo;twas day a&rsquo;most, to be made one with Andrey for
the rest of her life.&nbsp; He had left our place long before it
was light, and the folks that were up all waved their lanterns at
him, and flung up their hats as he went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The church of her parish was a mile and more from the
houses, and, as it was a wonderful fine day for the time of year,
the plan was that as soon as they were married they would make
out a holiday by driving straight off to Port Bredy, to see the
ships and the sea and the sojers, instead of coming back to a
meal at the house of the distant relation she lived wi&rsquo;,
and moping about there all the afternoon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, some folks noticed that Andrey walked with rather
wambling steps to church that morning; the truth o&rsquo;t was
that his nearest neighbour&rsquo;s child had been christened the
day before, and Andrey, having stood godfather, had stayed all
night keeping up the christening, for he had said to himself,
&ldquo;Not if I live to be thousand shall I again be made a
godfather one day, and a husband the next, and perhaps a father
the next, and therefore I&rsquo;ll make the most of the
blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that when he started from home in the
morning he had not been in bed at all.&nbsp; The result was, as I
say, that when he and his bride-to-he walked up the church to get
married, the pa&rsquo;son (who was a very strict man inside the
church, whatever he was outside) looked hard at Andrey, and said,
very sharp:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, my man?&nbsp; You are in
liquor.&nbsp; And so early, too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ashamed of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true, sir,&rdquo; says
Andrey.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can walk straight enough for practical
purposes.&nbsp; I can walk a chalk line,&rdquo; he says (meaning
no offence), &ldquo;as well as some other folk: and&mdash;&rdquo;
(getting hotter)&mdash;&ldquo;I reckon that if you, Pa&rsquo;son
Billy Toogood, had kept up a christening all night so thoroughly
as I have done, you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to stand at all; d---
me if you would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This answer made Pa&rsquo;son Billy&mdash;as they used
to call him&mdash;rather spitish, not to say hot, for he was a
warm-tempered man if provoked, and he said, very decidedly:
&ldquo;Well, I cannot marry you in this state; and I will
not!&nbsp; Go home and get sober!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he slapped the
book together like a rat-trap.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the bride burst out crying as if her heart would
break, for very fear that she would lose Andrey after all her
hard work to get him, and begged and implored the pa&rsquo;son to
go on with the ceremony.&nbsp; But no.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be a party to your solemnizing
matrimony with a tipsy man,&rdquo; says Mr. Toogood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not right and decent.&nbsp; I am sorry for you, my
young woman, but you&rsquo;d better go home again.&nbsp; I wonder
how you could think of bringing him here drunk like
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But if&mdash;if he don&rsquo;t come drunk he
won&rsquo;t come at all, sir!&rdquo; she says, through her
sobs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; says the
pa&rsquo;son; and plead as she might, it did not move him.&nbsp;
Then she tried him another way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, then, if you&rsquo;ll go home, sir, and
leave us here, and come back to the church in an hour or two,
I&rsquo;ll undertake to say that he shall be as sober as a
judge,&rdquo; she cries.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bide here, with
your permission; for if he once goes out of this here church
unmarried, all Van Amburgh&rsquo;s horses won&rsquo;t drag him
back again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; says the parson.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two hours, and then I&rsquo;ll
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And please, sir, lock the door, so that we
can&rsquo;t escape!&rdquo; says she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the parson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And let nobody know that we are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The pa&rsquo;son then took off his clane white
surplice, and went away; and the others consulted upon the best
means for keeping the matter a secret, which it was not a very
hard thing to do, the place being so lonely, and the hour so
early.&nbsp; The witnesses, Andrey&rsquo;s brother and
brother&rsquo;s wife, neither one o&rsquo; which cared about
Andrey&rsquo;s marrying Jane, and had come rather against their
will, said they couldn&rsquo;t wait two hours in that hole of a
place, wishing to get home to Longpuddle before
dinner-time.&nbsp; They were altogether so crusty that the clerk
said there was no difficulty in their doing as they wished.&nbsp;
They could go home as if their brother&rsquo;s wedding had
actually taken place and the married couple had gone onward for
their day&rsquo;s pleasure jaunt to Port Bredy as intended, he,
the clerk, and any casual passer-by would act as witnesses when
the pa&rsquo;son came back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This was agreed to, and away Andrey&rsquo;s relations
went, nothing loath, and the clerk shut the church door and
prepared to lock in the couple.&nbsp; The bride went up and
whispered to him, with her eyes a-streaming still.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;My dear good clerk,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;if
we bide here in the church, folk may see us through the winders,
and find out what has happened; and &rsquo;twould cause such a
talk and scandal that I never should get over it: and perhaps,
too, dear Andrey might try to get out and leave me!&nbsp; Will ye
lock us up in the tower, my dear good clerk?&rdquo; she
says.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tole him in there if you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The clerk had no objection to do this to oblige the
poor young woman, and they toled Andrey into the tower, and the
clerk locked &rsquo;em both up straightway, and then went home,
to return at the end of the two hours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pa&rsquo;son Toogood had not been long in his house
after leaving the church when he saw a gentleman in pink and
top-boots ride past his windows, and with a sudden flash of heat
he called to mind that the hounds met that day just on the edge
of his parish.&nbsp; The pa&rsquo;son was one who dearly loved
sport, and much he longed to be there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In short, except o&rsquo; Sundays and at tide-times in
the week, Pa&rsquo;son Billy was the life o&rsquo; the
Hunt.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true that he was poor, and that he rode
all of a heap, and that his black mare was rat-tailed and old,
and his tops older, and all over of one colour, whitey-brown, and
full o&rsquo; cracks.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;d been in at the death
of three thousand foxes.&nbsp; And&mdash;being a bachelor
man&mdash;every time he went to bed in summer he used to open the
bed at bottom and crawl up head foremost, to mind 'em of the
coming winter and the good sport he&rsquo;d have, and the foxes
going to earth.&nbsp; And whenever there was a christening at the
Squire&rsquo;s, and he had dinner there afterwards, as he always
did, he never failed to christen the chiel over again in a bottle
of port wine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now the clerk was the parson&rsquo;s groom and gardener
and jineral manager, and had just got back to his work in the
garden when he, too, saw the hunting man pass, and presently saw
lots more of &rsquo;em, noblemen and gentry, and then he saw the
hounds, the huntsman, Jim Treadhedge, the whipper-in, and I
don&rsquo;t know who besides.&nbsp; The clerk loved going to
cover as frantical as the pa&rsquo;son, so much so that whenever
he saw or heard the pack he could no more rule his feelings than
if they were the winds of heaven.&nbsp; He might be bedding, or
he might be sowing&mdash;all was forgot.&nbsp; So he throws down
his spade and rushes in to the pa&rsquo;son, who was by this time
as frantical to go as he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That there mare of yours, sir, do want exercise
bad, very bad, this morning!&rdquo; the clerk says, all of a
tremble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye think I&rsquo;d better trot
her round the downs for an hour, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;To be sure, she does want exercise badly.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll trot her round myself,&rdquo; says the parson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh&mdash;you&rsquo;ll trot her yerself?&nbsp;
Well, there&rsquo;s the cob, sir.&nbsp; Really that cob is
getting oncontrollable through biding in a stable so long!&nbsp;
If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind my putting on the
saddle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Very well.&nbsp; Take him out, certainly,&rdquo;
says the pa&rsquo;son, never caring what the clerk did so long as
he himself could get off immediately.&nbsp; So, scrambling into
his riding-boots and breeches as quick as he could, he rode off
towards the meet, intending to be back in an hour.&nbsp; No
sooner was he gone than the clerk mounted the cob, and was off
after him.&nbsp; When the pa&rsquo;son got to the meet, he found
a lot of friends, and was as jolly as he could be: the hounds
found a&rsquo;most as soon as they threw off, and there was great
excitement.&nbsp; So, forgetting that he had meant to go back at
once, away rides the pa&rsquo;son with the rest o&rsquo; the
hunt, all across the fallow ground that lies between Lippet Wood
and Green&rsquo;s Copse; and as he galloped he looked behind for
a moment, and there was the clerk close to his heels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ha, ha, clerk&mdash;you here?&rdquo; he
says.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, sir, here be I,&rdquo; says
t&rsquo;other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Fine exercise for the horses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ay, sir&mdash;hee, hee!&rdquo; says the
clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So they went on and on, into Green&rsquo;s Copse, then
across to Higher Jirton; then on across this very turnpike-road
to Climmerston Ridge, then away towards Yalbury Wood: up hill and
down dale, like the very wind, the clerk close to the
pa&rsquo;son, and the pa&rsquo;son not far from the hounds.&nbsp;
Never was there a finer run knowed with that pack than they had
that day; and neither pa&rsquo;son nor clerk thought one word
about the unmarried couple locked up in the church tower waiting
to get j&rsquo;ined.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;These hosses of yours, sir, will be much
improved by this!&rdquo; says the clerk as he rode along, just a
neck behind the pa&rsquo;son.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a happy
thought of your reverent mind to bring &rsquo;em out
to-day.&nbsp; Why, it may be frosty in a day or two, and then the
poor things mid not be able to leave the stable for
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They may not, they may not, it is true.&nbsp; A
merciful man is merciful to his beast,&rdquo; says the
pa&rsquo;son.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hee, hee!&rdquo; says the clerk, glancing sly
into the pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; says the pa&rsquo;son, a-glancing
back into the clerk&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; he
shouts, as he sees the fox break cover at that moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; cries the clerk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There he goes!&nbsp; Why, dammy, there&rsquo;s two
foxes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hush, clerk, hush!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let me hear
that word again!&nbsp; Remember our calling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;True, sir, true.&nbsp; But really, good sport do
carry away a man so, that he&rsquo;s apt to forget his high
persuasion!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the next minute the corner of the
clerk&rsquo;s eye shot again into the corner of the
pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s, and the pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s back again to
the clerk&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hee, hee!&rdquo; said the
clerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said Pa&rsquo;son Toogood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; says the clerk again,
&ldquo;this is better than crying Amen to your Ever-and-ever on a
winter&rsquo;s morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, indeed, clerk!&nbsp; To everything
there&rsquo;s a season,&rdquo; says Pa&rsquo;son Toogood, quite
pat, for he was a learned Christian man when he liked, and had
chapter and ve&rsquo;se at his tongue&rsquo;s end, as a
pa&rsquo;son should.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At last, late in the day, the hunting came to an end by
the fox running into a&rsquo; old woman&rsquo;s cottage, under
her table, and up the clock-case.&nbsp; The pa&rsquo;son and
clerk were among the first in at the death, their faces a-staring
in at the old woman&rsquo;s winder, and the clock striking as
he&rsquo;d never been heard to strik&rsquo; before.&nbsp; Then
came the question of finding their way home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Neither the pa&rsquo;son nor the clerk knowed how they
were going to do this, for their beasts were wellnigh tired down
to the ground.&nbsp; But they started back-along as well as they
could, though they were so done up that they could only drag
along at a&rsquo; amble, and not much of that at a time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We shall never, never get there!&rdquo; groaned
Mr. Toogood, quite bowed down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; groans the clerk.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a judgment upon us for our
iniquities!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I fear it is,&rdquo; murmurs the
pa&rsquo;son.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, &rsquo;twas quite dark afore they entered the
pa&rsquo;sonage gate, having crept into the parish as quiet as if
they&rsquo;d stole a hammer, little wishing their congregation to
know what they&rsquo;d been up to all day long.&nbsp; And as they
were so dog-tired, and so anxious about the horses, never once
did they think of the unmarried couple.&nbsp; As soon as ever the
horses had been stabled and fed, and the pa&rsquo;son and clerk
had had a bit and a sup theirselves, they went to bed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next morning when Pa&rsquo;son Toogood was at
breakfast, thinking of the glorious sport he&rsquo;d had the day
before, the clerk came in a hurry to the door and asked to see
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It has just come into my mind, sir, that
we&rsquo;ve forgot all about the couple that we was to have
married yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The half-chawed victuals dropped from the
pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s mouth as if he&rsquo;d been shot.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bless my soul,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;so we have!&nbsp;
How very awkward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It is, sir; very.&nbsp; Perhaps we&rsquo;ve
ruined the &rsquo;ooman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ah&mdash;to be sure&mdash;I remember!&nbsp; She
ought to have been married before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If anything has happened to her up in that there
tower, and no doctor or nuss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;Ah&mdash;poor thing!&rsquo; sighed the women.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;&mdash;&rsquo;twill be a quarter-sessions matter
for us, not to speak of the disgrace to the Church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good God, clerk, don&rsquo;t drive me
wild!&rdquo; says the pa&rsquo;son.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why the hell
didn&rsquo;t I marry &rsquo;em, drunk or sober!&rdquo;&nbsp;
(Pa&rsquo;sons used to cuss in them days like plain honest
men.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you been to the church to see what
happened to them, or inquired in the village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not I, sir!&nbsp; It only came into my head a
moment ago, and I always like to be second to you in church
matters.&nbsp; You could have knocked me down with a
sparrer&rsquo;s feather when I thought o&rsquo;t, sir; I assure
&rsquo;ee you could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the parson jumped up from his breakfast, and
together they went off to the church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It is not at all likely that they are there
now,&rdquo; says Mr. Toogood, as they went; &ldquo;and indeed I
hope they are not.&nbsp; They be pretty sure to have
&rsquo;scaped and gone home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, they opened the church-hatch, entered the
churchyard, and looking up at the tower, there they seed a little
small white face at the belfry-winder, and a little small hand
waving.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the bride.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;God my life, clerk,&rdquo; says Mr. Toogood,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to face &rsquo;em!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he sank down upon a tombstone.&nbsp; &ldquo;How I wish I
hadn&rsquo;t been so cussed particular!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rsquo;twas a pity we didn&rsquo;t
finish it when we&rsquo;d begun,&rdquo; the clerk said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Still, since the feelings of your holy priestcraft
wouldn&rsquo;t let ye, the couple must put up with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;True, clerk, true!&nbsp; Does she look as if
anything premature had took place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see her no lower down than her
arm-pits, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well&mdash;how do her face look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It do look mighty white!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, we must know the worst!&nbsp; Dear me, how
the small of my back do ache from that ride yesterday! . . . But
to more godly business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They went on into the church, and unlocked the tower
stairs, and immediately poor Jane and Andrey busted out like
starved mice from a cupboard, Andrey limp and sober enough now,
and his bride pale and cold, but otherwise as usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What,&rdquo; says the pa&rsquo;son, with a great
breath of relief, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t been here ever
since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, we have, sir!&rdquo; says the bride,
sinking down upon a seat in her weakness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a
morsel, wet or dry, have we had since!&nbsp; It was impossible to
get out without help, and here we&rsquo;ve stayed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you shout, good
souls?&rdquo; said the pa&rsquo;son.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t let me,&rdquo; says
Andrey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Because we were so ashamed at what had led to
it,&rdquo; sobs Jane.&nbsp; &ldquo;We felt that if it were noised
abroad it would cling to us all our lives!&nbsp; Once or twice
Andrey had a good mind to toll the bell, but then he said:
&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll starve first.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t bring
disgrace on my name and yours, my dear.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so we
waited and waited, and walked round and round; but never did you
come till now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;To my regret!&rdquo; says the parson.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, then, we will soon get it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&mdash;I should like some victuals,&rdquo; said
Andrey, &ldquo;&rsquo;twould gie me courage if it is only a crust
o&rsquo; bread and a&rsquo; onion; for I am that leery that I can
feel my stomach rubbing against my backbone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I think we had better get it done,&rdquo; said
the bride, a bit anxious in manner; &ldquo;since we are all here
convenient, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Andrey gave way about the victuals, and the clerk
called in a second witness who wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to gossip
about it, and soon the knot was tied, and the bride looked
smiling and calm forthwith, and Andrey limper than ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Pa&rsquo;son Toogood,
&ldquo;you two must come to my house, and have a good lining put
to your insides before you go a step further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were very glad of the offer, and went out of the
churchyard by one path while the pa&rsquo;son and clerk went out
by the other, and so did not attract notice, it being still
early.&nbsp; They entered the rectory as if they&rsquo;d just
come back from their trip to Port Bredy; and then they knocked in
the victuals and drink till they could hold no more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a long while before the story of what they had
gone through was known, but it was talked of in time, and they
themselves laugh over it now; though what Jane got for her pains
was no great bargain after all.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true she saved
her name.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was that the same Andrey who went to the squire&rsquo;s
house as one of the Christmas fiddlers?&rsquo; asked the
seedsman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied Mr. Profitt, the
schoolmaster.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was his father did that.&nbsp; Ay,
it was all owing to his being such a man for eating and
drinking.&rsquo;&nbsp; Finding that he had the ear of the
audience, the schoolmaster continued without delay:&mdash;</p>
<h3>OLD ANDREY&rsquo;S EXPERIENCE AS A MUSICIAN</h3>
<p>&lsquo;I was one of the choir-boys at that time, and we and
the players were to appear at the manor-house as usual that
Christmas week, to play and sing in the hall to the
squire&rsquo;s people and visitors (among &rsquo;em being the
archdeacon, Lord and Lady Baxby, and I don&rsquo;t know who);
afterwards going, as we always did, to have a good supper in the
servants&rsquo; hall.&nbsp; Andrew knew this was the custom, and
meeting us when we were starting to go, he said to us:
&ldquo;Lord, how I should like to join in that meal of beef, and
turkey, and plum-pudding, and ale, that you happy ones be going
to just now!&nbsp; One more or less will make no difference to
the squire.&nbsp; I am too old to pass as a singing boy, and too
bearded to pass as a singing girl; can ye lend me a fiddle,
neighbours, that I may come with ye as a bandsman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we didn&rsquo;t like to be hard upon him, and
lent him an old one, though Andrew knew no more of music than the
Cerne Giant; and armed with the instrument he walked up to the
squire&rsquo;s house with the others of us at the time appointed,
and went in boldly, his fiddle under his arm.&nbsp; He made
himself as natural as he could in opening the music-books and
moving the candles to the best points for throwing light upon the
notes; and all went well till we had played and sung &ldquo;While
shepherds watch,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Star, arise,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Hark the glad sound.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the squire&rsquo;s
mother, a tall gruff old lady, who was much interested in
church-music, said quite unexpectedly to Andrew: &ldquo;My man, I
see you don&rsquo;t play your instrument with the rest.&nbsp; How
is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every one of the choir was ready to sink into the earth
with concern at the fix Andrew was in.&nbsp; We could see that he
had fallen into a cold sweat, and how he would get out of it we
did not know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a misfortune, mem,&rdquo; he
says, bowing as meek as a child.&nbsp; &ldquo;Coming along the
road I fell down and broke my bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, I am sorry to hear that,&rdquo; says
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it be mended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh no, mem,&rdquo; says Andrew.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas broke all to splinters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for you,&rdquo;
says she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then it seemed all over, and we played
&ldquo;Rejoice, ye drowsy mortals all,&rdquo; in D and two
sharps.&nbsp; But no sooner had we got through it than she says
to Andrew,</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent up into the attic, where we have
some old musical instruments, and found a bow for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she hands the bow to poor wretched Andrew,
who didn&rsquo;t even know which end to take hold of.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now we shall have the full accompaniment,&rdquo; says
she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Andrew&rsquo;s face looked as if it were made of rotten
apple as he stood in the circle of players in front of his book;
for if there was one person in the parish that everybody was
afraid of, &rsquo;twas this hook-nosed old lady.&nbsp; However,
by keeping a little behind the next man he managed to make
pretence of beginning, sawing away with his bow without letting
it touch the strings, so that it looked as if he were driving
into the tune with heart and soul.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a question if
he wouldn&rsquo;t have got through all right if one of the
squire&rsquo;s visitors (no other than the archdeacon)
hadn&rsquo;t noticed that he held the fiddle upside down, the nut
under his chin, and the tail-piece in his hand; and they began to
crowd round him, thinking &rsquo;twas some new way of
performing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This revealed everything; the squire&rsquo;s mother had
Andrew turned out of the house as a vile impostor, and there was
great interruption to the harmony of the proceedings, the squire
declaring he should have notice to leave his cottage that day
fortnight.&nbsp; However, when we got to the servants&rsquo; hall
there sat Andrew, who had been let in at the back door by the
orders of the squire&rsquo;s wife, after being turned out at the
front by the orders of the squire, and nothing more was heard
about his leaving his cottage.&nbsp; But Andrew never performed
in public as a musician after that night; and now he&rsquo;s dead
and gone, poor man, as we all shall be!&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had quite forgotten the old choir, with their fiddles
and bass-viols,&rsquo; said the home-comer, musingly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Are they still going on the same as of old?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless the man!&rsquo; said Christopher Twink, the
master-thatcher; &lsquo;why, they&rsquo;ve been done away with
these twenty year.&nbsp; A young teetotaler plays the organ in
church now, and plays it very well; though &rsquo;tis not quite
such good music as in old times, because the organ is one of them
that go with a winch, and the young teetotaler says he
can&rsquo;t always throw the proper feeling into the tune without
wellnigh working his arms off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did they make the change, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, partly because of fashion, partly because the old
musicians got into a sort of scrape.&nbsp; A terrible scrape
&rsquo;twas too&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it, John?&nbsp; I shall never
forget it&mdash;never!&nbsp; They lost their character as
officers of the church as complete as if they&rsquo;d never had
any character at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was very bad for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; The master-thatcher attentively
regarded past times as if they lay about a mile off, and went
on:&mdash;</p>
<h3>ABSENT-MINDEDNESS IN A PARISH CHOIR</h3>
<p>&lsquo;It happened on Sunday after Christmas&mdash;the last
Sunday ever they played in Longpuddle church gallery, as it
turned out, though they didn&rsquo;t know it then.&nbsp; As you
may know, sir, the players formed a very good band&mdash;almost
as good as the Mellstock parish players that were led by the
Dewys; and that&rsquo;s saying a great deal.&nbsp; There was
Nicholas Puddingcome, the leader, with the first fiddle; there
was Timothy Thomas, the bass-viol man; John Biles, the tenor
fiddler; Dan&rsquo;l Hornhead, with the serpent; Robert Dowdle,
with the clarionet; and Mr. Nicks, with the oboe&mdash;all sound
and powerful musicians, and strong-winded men&mdash;they that
blowed.&nbsp; For that reason they were very much in demand
Christmas week for little reels and dancing parties; for they
could turn a jig or a hornpipe out of hand as well as ever they
could turn out a psalm, and perhaps better, not to speak
irreverent.&nbsp; In short, one half-hour they could be playing a
Christmas carol in the squire&rsquo;s hall to the ladies and
gentlemen, and drinking tea and coffee with &rsquo;em as modest
as saints; and the next, at The Tinker&rsquo;s Arms, blazing away
like wild horses with the &ldquo;Dashing White Sergeant&rdquo; to
nine couple of dancers and more, and swallowing rum-and-cider hot
as flame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, this Christmas they&rsquo;d been out to one
rattling randy after another every night, and had got next to no
sleep at all.&nbsp; Then came the Sunday after Christmas, their
fatal day.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas so mortal cold that year that they
could hardly sit in the gallery; for though the congregation down
in the body of the church had a stove to keep off the frost, the
players in the gallery had nothing at all.&nbsp; So Nicholas said
at morning service, when &rsquo;twas freezing an inch an hour,
&ldquo;Please the Lord I won&rsquo;t stand this numbing weather
no longer: this afternoon we&rsquo;ll have something in our
insides to make us warm, if it cost a king&rsquo;s
ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So he brought a gallon of hot brandy and beer, ready
mixed, to church with him in the afternoon, and by keeping the
jar well wrapped up in Timothy Thomas&rsquo;s bass-viol bag it
kept drinkably warm till they wanted it, which was just a
thimbleful in the Absolution, and another after the Creed, and
the remainder at the beginning o&rsquo; the sermon.&nbsp; When
they&rsquo;d had the last pull they felt quite comfortable and
warm, and as the sermon went on&mdash;most unfortunately for
&rsquo;em it was a long one that afternoon&mdash;they fell
asleep, every man jack of &rsquo;em; and there they slept on as
sound as rocks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas a very dark afternoon, and by the end of
the sermon all you could see of the inside of the church were the
pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s two candles alongside of him in the pulpit,
and his spaking face behind &rsquo;em.&nbsp; The sermon being
ended at last, the pa&rsquo;son gie&rsquo;d out the Evening
Hymn.&nbsp; But no choir set about sounding up the tune, and the
people began to turn their heads to learn the reason why, and
then Levi Limpet, a boy who sat in the gallery, nudged Timothy
and Nicholas, and said, &ldquo;Begin! begin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hey? what?&rdquo; says Nicholas, starting up;
and the church being so dark and his head so muddled he thought
he was at the party they had played at all the night before, and
away he went, bow and fiddle, at &ldquo;The Devil among the
Tailors,&rdquo; the favourite jig of our neighbourhood at that
time.&nbsp; The rest of the band, being in the same state of mind
and nothing doubting, followed their leader with all their
strength, according to custom.&nbsp; They poured out that there
tune till the lower bass notes of &ldquo;The Devil among the
Tailors&rdquo; made the cobwebs in the roof shiver like ghosts;
then Nicholas, seeing nobody moved, shouted out as he scraped (in
his usual commanding way at dances when the folk didn&rsquo;t
know the figures), &ldquo;Top couples cross hands!&nbsp; And when
I make the fiddle squeak at the end, every man kiss his pardner
under the mistletoe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The boy Levi was so frightened that he bolted down the
gallery stairs and out homeward like lightning.&nbsp; The
pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s hair fairly stood on end when he heard the
evil tune raging through the church, and thinking the choir had
gone crazy he held up his hand and said: &ldquo;Stop, stop,
stop!&nbsp; Stop, stop!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;&nbsp; But
they didn&rsquo;t hear&rsquo;n for the noise of their own
playing, and the more he called the louder they played.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the folks came out of their pews, wondering down
to the ground, and saying: &ldquo;What do they mean by such
wickedness!&nbsp; We shall be consumed like Sodom and
Gomorrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the squire came out of his pew lined wi&rsquo;
green baize, where lots of lords and ladies visiting at the house
were worshipping along with him, and went and stood in front of
the gallery, and shook his fist in the musicians&rsquo; faces,
saying, &ldquo;What!&nbsp; In this reverent edifice!&nbsp;
What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And at last they heard&rsquo;n through their playing,
and stopped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Never such an insulting, disgraceful
thing&mdash;never!&rdquo; says the squire, who couldn&rsquo;t
rule his passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; says the pa&rsquo;son, who had
come down and stood beside him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Not if the Angels of Heaven,&rdquo; says the
squire (he was a wickedish man, the squire was, though now for
once he happened to be on the Lord&rsquo;s side)&mdash;&ldquo;not
if the Angels of Heaven come down,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;shall
one of you villanous players ever sound a note in this church
again; for the insult to me, and my family, and my visitors, and
God Almighty, that you&rsquo;ve a-perpetrated this
afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the unfortunate church band came to their senses,
and remembered where they were; and &rsquo;twas a sight to see
Nicholas Pudding come and Timothy Thomas and John Biles creep
down the gallery stairs with their fiddles under their arms, and
poor Dan&rsquo;l Hornhead with his serpent, and Robert Dowdle
with his clarionet, all looking as little as ninepins; and out
they went.&nbsp; The pa&rsquo;son might have forgi&rsquo;ed
&rsquo;em when he learned the truth o&rsquo;t, but the squire
would not.&nbsp; That very week he sent for a barrel-organ that
would play two-and-twenty new psalm-tunes, so exact and
particular that, however sinful inclined you was, you could play
nothing but psalm-tunes whatsomever.&nbsp; He had a really
respectable man to turn the winch, as I said, and the old players
played no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, of course, my old acquaintance, the annuitant,
Mrs. Winter, who always seemed to have something on her mind, is
dead and gone?&rsquo; said the home-comer, after a long
silence.</p>
<p>Nobody in the van seemed to recollect the name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, she must be dead long since: she was seventy
when I as a child knew her,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can recollect Mrs. Winter very well, if nobody else
can,&rsquo; said the aged groceress.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,
she&rsquo;s been dead these five-and-twenty year at least.&nbsp;
You knew what it was upon her mind, sir, that gave her that
hollow-eyed look, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It had something to do with a son of hers, I think I
once was told.&nbsp; But I was too young to know
particulars.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The groceress sighed as she conjured up a vision of days long
past.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;it had all to
do with a son.&rsquo;&nbsp; Finding that the van was still in a
listening mood, she spoke on:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE WINTERS AND THE PALMLEYS</h3>
<p>&lsquo;To go back to the beginning&mdash;if one
must&mdash;there were two women in the parish when I was a child,
who were to a certain extent rivals in good looks.&nbsp; Never
mind particulars, but in consequence of this they were at
daggers-drawn, and they did not love each other any better when
one of them tempted the other&rsquo;s lover away from her and
married him.&nbsp; He was a young man of the name of Winter, and
in due time they had a son.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The other woman did not marry for many years: but when
she was about thirty a quiet man named Palmley asked her to be
his wife, and she accepted him.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mind when
the Palmleys were Longpuddle folk, but I do well.&nbsp; She had a
son also, who was, of course, nine or ten years younger than the
son of the first.&nbsp; The child proved to be of rather weak
intellect, though his mother loved him as the apple of her
eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This woman&rsquo;s husband died when the child was
eight years old, and left his widow and boy in poverty.&nbsp; Her
former rival, also a widow now, but fairly well provided for,
offered for pity&rsquo;s sake to take the child as errand-boy,
small as he was, her own son, Jack, being hard upon
seventeen.&nbsp; Her poor neighbour could do no better than let
the child go there.&nbsp; And to the richer woman&rsquo;s house
little Palmley straightway went.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, in some way or other&mdash;how, it was never
exactly known&mdash;the thriving woman, Mrs. Winter, sent the
little boy with a message to the next village one December day,
much against his will.&nbsp; It was getting dark, and the child
prayed to be allowed not to go, because he would be afraid coming
home.&nbsp; But the mistress insisted, more out of
thoughtlessness than cruelty, and the child went.&nbsp; On his
way back he had to pass through Yalbury Wood, and something came
out from behind a tree and frightened him into fits.&nbsp; The
child was quite ruined by it; he became quite a drivelling idiot,
and soon afterward died.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the other woman had nothing left to live for, and
vowed vengeance against that rival who had first won away her
lover, and now had been the cause of her bereavement.&nbsp; This
last affliction was certainly not intended by her thriving
acquaintance, though it must be owned that when it was done she
seemed but little concerned.&nbsp; Whatever vengeance poor Mrs.
Palmley felt, she had no opportunity of carrying it out, and time
might have softened her feelings into forgetfulness of her
supposed wrongs as she dragged on her lonely life.&nbsp; So
matters stood when, a year after the death of the child, Mrs.
Palmley&rsquo;s niece, who had been born and bred in the city of
Exonbury, came to live with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This young woman&mdash;Miss Harriet Palmley&mdash;was a
proud and handsome girl, very well brought up, and more stylish
and genteel than the people of our village, as was natural,
considering where she came from.&nbsp; She regarded herself as
much above Mrs. Winter and her son in position as Mrs. Winter and
her son considered themselves above poor Mrs. Palmley.&nbsp; But
love is an unceremonious thing, and what in the world should
happen but that young Jack Winter must fall wofully and wildly in
love with Harriet Palmley almost as soon as he saw her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She, being better educated than he, and caring nothing
for the village notion of his mother&rsquo;s superiority to her
aunt, did not give him much encouragement.&nbsp; But Longpuddle
being no very large world, the two could not help seeing a good
deal of each other while she was staying there, and, disdainful
young woman as she was, she did seem to take a little pleasure in
his attentions and advances.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day when they were picking apples together, he
asked her to marry him.&nbsp; She had not expected anything so
practical as that at so early a time, and was led by her surprise
into a half-promise; at any rate she did not absolutely refuse
him, and accepted some little presents that he made her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he saw that her view of him was rather as a simple
village lad than as a young man to look up to, and he felt that
he must do something bold to secure her.&nbsp; So he said one
day, &ldquo;I am going away, to try to get into a better position
than I can get here.&rdquo;&nbsp; In two or three weeks he wished
her good-bye, and went away to Monksbury, to superintend a farm,
with a view to start as a farmer himself; and from there he wrote
regularly to her, as if their marriage were an understood
thing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now Harriet liked the young man&rsquo;s presents and
the admiration of his eyes; but on paper he was less attractive
to her.&nbsp; Her mother had been a school-mistress, and Harriet
had besides a natural aptitude for pen-and-ink work, in days when
to be a ready writer was not such a common thing as it is now,
and when actual handwriting was valued as an accomplishment in
itself.&nbsp; Jack Winter&rsquo;s performances in the shape of
love-letters quite jarred her city nerves and her finer taste,
and when she answered one of them, in the lovely running hand
that she took such pride in, she very strictly and loftily bade
him to practise with a pen and spelling-book if he wished to
please her.&nbsp; Whether he listened to her request or not
nobody knows, but his letters did not improve.&nbsp; He ventured
to tell her in his clumsy way that if her heart were more warm
towards him she would not be so nice about his handwriting and
spelling; which indeed was true enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, in Jack&rsquo;s absence the weak flame that had
been set alight in Harriet&rsquo;s heart soon sank low, and at
last went out altogether.&nbsp; He wrote and wrote, and begged
and prayed her to give a reason for her coldness; and then she
told him plainly that she was town born, and he was not
sufficiently well educated to please her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack Winter&rsquo;s want of pen-and-ink training did
not make him less thin-skinned than others; in fact, he was
terribly tender and touchy about anything.&nbsp; This reason that
she gave for finally throwing him over grieved him, shamed him,
and mortified him more than can be told in these times, the pride
of that day in being able to write with beautiful flourishes, and
the sorrow at not being able to do so, raging so high.&nbsp; Jack
replied to her with an angry note, and then she hit back with
smart little stings, telling him how many words he had misspelt
in his last letter, and declaring again that this alone was
sufficient justification for any woman to put an end to an
understanding with him.&nbsp; Her husband must be a better
scholar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He bore her rejection of him in silence, but his
suffering was sharp&mdash;all the sharper in being untold.&nbsp;
She communicated with Jack no more; and as his reason for going
out into the world had been only to provide a home worthy of her,
he had no further object in planning such a home now that she was
lost to him.&nbsp; He therefore gave up the farming occupation by
which he had hoped to make himself a master-farmer, and left the
spot to return to his mother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As soon as he got back to Longpuddle he found that
Harriet had already looked wi&rsquo; favour upon another
lover.&nbsp; He was a young road-contractor, and Jack could not
but admit that his rival was both in manners and scholarship much
ahead of him.&nbsp; Indeed, a more sensible match for the beauty
who had been dropped into the village by fate could hardly have
been found than this man, who could offer her so much better a
chance than Jack could have done, with his uncertain future and
narrow abilities for grappling with the world.&nbsp; The fact was
so clear to him that he could hardly blame her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day by accident Jack saw on a scrap of paper the
handwriting of Harriet&rsquo;s new beloved.&nbsp; It was flowing
like a stream, well spelt, the work of a man accustomed to the
ink-bottle and the dictionary, of a man already called in the
parish a good scholar.&nbsp; And then it struck all of a sudden
into Jack&rsquo;s mind what a contrast the letters of this young
man must make to his own miserable old letters, and how
ridiculous they must make his lines appear.&nbsp; He groaned and
wished he had never written to her, and wondered if she had ever
kept his poor performances.&nbsp; Possibly she had kept them, for
women are in the habit of doing that, he thought, and whilst they
were in her hands there was always a chance of his honest, stupid
love-assurances to her being joked over by Harriet with her
present lover, or by anybody who should accidentally uncover
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The nervous, moody young man could not bear the thought
of it, and at length decided to ask her to return them, as was
proper when engagements were broken off.&nbsp; He was some hours
in framing, copying, and recopying the short note in which he
made his request, and having finished it he sent it to her
house.&nbsp; His messenger came back with the answer, by word of
mouth, that Miss Palmley bade him say she should not part with
what was hers, and wondered at his boldness in troubling her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack was much affronted at this, and determined to go
for his letters himself.&nbsp; He chose a time when he knew she
was at home, and knocked and went in without much ceremony; for
though Harriet was so high and mighty, Jack had small respect for
her aunt, Mrs. Palmley, whose little child had been his
boot-cleaner in earlier days.&nbsp; Harriet was in the room, this
being the first time they had met since she had jilted him.&nbsp;
He asked for his letters with a stern and bitter look at her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At first she said he might have them for all that she
cared, and took them out of the bureau where she kept them.&nbsp;
Then she glanced over the outside one of the packet, and suddenly
altering her mind, she told him shortly that his request was a
silly one, and slipped the letters into her aunt&rsquo;s
work-box, which stood open on the table, locking it, and saying
with a bantering laugh that of course she thought it best to keep
&rsquo;em, since they might be useful to produce as evidence that
she had good cause for declining to marry him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He blazed up hot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me those
letters!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, they are not,&rdquo; she replied;
&ldquo;they are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Whos&rsquo;ever they are I want them
back,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be made
sport of for my penmanship: you&rsquo;ve another young man now!
he has your confidence, and you pour all your tales into his
ear.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be showing them to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said my lady Harriet, with calm
coolness, like the heartless woman that she was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her manner so maddened him that he made a step towards
the work-box, but she snatched it up, locked it in the bureau,
and turned upon him triumphant.&nbsp; For a moment he seemed to
be going to wrench the key of the bureau out of her hand; but he
stopped himself, and swung round upon his heel and went away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When he was out-of-doors alone, and it got night, he
walked about restless, and stinging with the sense of being
beaten at all points by her.&nbsp; He could not help fancying her
telling her new lover or her acquaintances of this scene with
himself, and laughing with them over those poor blotted, crooked
lines of his that he had been so anxious to obtain.&nbsp; As the
evening passed on he worked himself into a dogged resolution to
have them back at any price, come what might.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the dead of night he came out of his mother&rsquo;s
house by the back door, and creeping through the garden hedge
went along the field adjoining till he reached the back of her
aunt&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; The moon struck bright and flat upon
the walls, &rsquo;twas said, and every shiny leaf of the creepers
was like a little looking-glass in the rays.&nbsp; From long
acquaintance Jack knew the arrangement and position of everything
in Mrs. Palmley&rsquo;s house as well as in his own
mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The back window close to him was a casement
with little leaded squares, as it is to this day, and was, as
now, one of two lighting the sitting-room.&nbsp; The other, being
in front, was closed up with shutters, but this back one had not
even a blind, and the moonlight as it streamed in showed every
article of the furniture to him outside.&nbsp; To the right of
the room is the fireplace, as you may remember; to the left was
the bureau at that time; inside the bureau was Harriet&rsquo;s
work-box, as he supposed (though it was really her aunt&rsquo;s),
and inside the work-box were his letters.&nbsp; Well, he took out
his pocket-knife, and without noise lifted the leading of one of
the panes, so that he could take out the glass, and putting his
hand through the hole he unfastened the casement, and climbed in
through the opening.&nbsp; All the household&mdash;that is to
say, Mrs. Palmley, Harriet, and the little
maid-servant&mdash;were asleep.&nbsp; Jack went straight to the
bureau, so he said, hoping it might have been unfastened
again&mdash;it not being kept locked in ordinary&mdash;but
Harriet had never unfastened it since she secured her letters
there the day before.&nbsp; Jack told afterward how he thought of
her asleep upstairs, caring nothing for him, and of the way she
had made sport of him and of his letters; and having advanced so
far, he was not to be hindered now.&nbsp; By forcing the large
blade of his knife under the flap of the bureau, he burst the
weak lock; within was the rosewood work-box just as she had
placed it in her hurry to keep it from him.&nbsp; There being no
time to spare for getting the letters out of it then, he took it
under his arm, shut the bureau, and made the best of his way out
of the house, latching the casement behind him, and refixing the
pane of glass in its place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Winter found his way back to his mother&rsquo;s as he
had come, and being dog-tired, crept upstairs to bed, hiding the
box till he could destroy its contents.&nbsp; The next morning
early he set about doing this, and carried it to the linhay at
the back of his mother&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; Here by the hearth
he opened the box, and began burning one by one the letters that
had cost him so much labour to write and shame to think of,
meaning to return the box to Harriet, after repairing the slight
damage he had caused it by opening it without a key, with a
note&mdash;the last she would ever receive from him&mdash;telling
her triumphantly that in refusing to return what he had asked for
she had calculated too surely upon his submission to her
whims.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But on removing the last letter from the box he
received a shock; for underneath it, at the very bottom, lay
money&mdash;several golden guineas&mdash;&ldquo;Doubtless
Harriet&rsquo;s pocket-money,&rdquo; he said to himself; though
it was not, but Mrs. Palmley&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Before he had got
over his qualms at this discovery he heard footsteps coming
through the house-passage to where he was.&nbsp; In haste he
pushed the box and what was in it under some brushwood which lay
in the linhay; but Jack had been already seen.&nbsp; Two
constables entered the out-house, and seized him as he knelt
before the fireplace, securing the work-box and all it contained
at the same moment.&nbsp; They had come to apprehend him on a
charge of breaking into the dwelling-house of Mrs. Palmley on the
night preceding; and almost before the lad knew what had happened
to him they were leading him along the lane that connects that
end of the village with this turnpike-road, and along they
marched him between &rsquo;em all the way to Casterbridge
jail.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jack&rsquo;s act amounted to night
burglary&mdash;though he had never thought of it&mdash;and
burglary was felony, and a capital offence in those days.&nbsp;
His figure had been seen by some one against the bright wall as
he came away from Mrs. Palmley&rsquo;s back window, and the box
and money were found in his possession, while the evidence of the
broken bureau-lock and tinkered window-pane was more than enough
for circumstantial detail.&nbsp; Whether his protestation that he
went only for his letters, which he believed to be wrongfully
kept from him, would have availed him anything if supported by
other evidence I do not know; but the one person who could have
borne it out was Harriet, and she acted entirely under the sway
of her aunt.&nbsp; That aunt was deadly towards Jack
Winter.&nbsp; Mrs. Palmley&rsquo;s time had come.&nbsp; Here was
her revenge upon the woman who had first won away her lover, and
next ruined and deprived her of her heart&rsquo;s
treasure&mdash;her little son.&nbsp; When the assize week drew
on, and Jack had to stand his trial, Harriet did not appear in
the case at all, which was allowed to take its course, Mrs.
Palmley testifying to the general facts of the burglary.&nbsp;
Whether Harriet would have come forward if Jack had appealed to
her is not known; possibly she would have done it for
pity&rsquo;s sake; but Jack was too proud to ask a single favour
of a girl who had jilted him; and he let her alone.&nbsp; The
trial was a short one, and the death sentence was passed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The day o&rsquo; young Jack&rsquo;s execution was a
cold dusty Saturday in March.&nbsp; He was so boyish and slim
that they were obliged in mercy to hang him in the heaviest
fetters kept in the jail, lest his heft should not break his
neck, and they weighed so upon him that he could hardly drag
himself up to the drop.&nbsp; At that time the gover&rsquo;ment
was not strict about burying the body of an executed person
within the precincts of the prison, and at the earnest prayer of
his poor mother his body was allowed to be brought home.&nbsp;
All the parish waited at their cottage doors in the evening for
its arrival: I remember how, as a very little girl, I stood by my
mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; About eight o&rsquo;clock, as we
hearkened on our door-stones in the cold bright starlight, we
could hear the faint crackle of a waggon from the direction of
the turnpike-road.&nbsp; The noise was lost as the waggon dropped
into a hollow, then it was plain again as it lumbered down the
next long incline, and presently it entered Longpuddle.&nbsp; The
coffin was laid in the belfry for the night, and the next day,
Sunday, between the services, we buried him.&nbsp; A funeral
sermon was preached the same afternoon, the text chosen being,
&ldquo;He was the only son of his mother, and she was a
widow.&rdquo; . . . Yes, they were cruel times!</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for Harriet, she and her lover were married in due
time; but by all account her life was no jocund one.&nbsp; She
and her good-man found that they could not live comfortably at
Longpuddle, by reason of her connection with Jack&rsquo;s
misfortunes, and they settled in a distant town, and were no more
heard of by us; Mrs. Palmley, too, found it advisable to join
&rsquo;em shortly after.&nbsp; The dark-eyed, gaunt old Mrs.
Winter, remembered by the emigrant gentleman here, was, as you
will have foreseen, the Mrs. Winter of this story; and I can well
call to mind how lonely she was, how afraid the children were of
her, and how she kept herself as a stranger among us, though she
lived so long.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Longpuddle has had her sad experiences as well as her
sunny ones,&rsquo; said Mr. Lackland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes.&nbsp; But I am thankful to say not many like
that, though good and bad have lived among us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was Georgy Crookhill&mdash;he was one of the
shady sort, as I have reason to know,&rsquo; observed the
registrar, with the manner of a man who would like to have his
say also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I used to hear what he was as a boy at
school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, as he began so he went on.&nbsp; It never got so
far as a hanging matter with him, to be sure; but he had some
narrow escapes of penal servitude; and once it was a case of the
biter bit.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>INCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF MR. GEORGE CROOKHILL</h3>
<p>&lsquo;One day,&rsquo; the registrar continued, &lsquo;Georgy
was ambling out of Melchester on a miserable screw, the fair
being just over, when he saw in front of him a fine-looking young
farmer riding out of the town in the same direction.&nbsp; He was
mounted on a good strong handsome animal, worth fifty guineas if
worth a crown.&nbsp; When they were going up Bissett Hill, Georgy
made it his business to overtake the young farmer.&nbsp; They
passed the time o&rsquo; day to one another; Georgy spoke of the
state of the roads, and jogged alongside the well-mounted
stranger in very friendly conversation.&nbsp; The farmer had not
been inclined to say much to Georgy at first, but by degrees he
grew quite affable too&mdash;as friendly as Georgy was toward
him.&nbsp; He told Crookhill that he had been doing business at
Melchester fair, and was going on as far as Shottsford-Forum that
night, so as to reach Casterbridge market the next day.&nbsp;
When they came to Woodyates Inn they stopped to bait their
horses, and agreed to drink together; with this they got more
friendly than ever, and on they went again.&nbsp; Before they had
nearly reached Shottsford it came on to rain, and as they were
now passing through the village of Trantridge, and it was quite
dark, Georgy persuaded the young farmer to go no further that
night; the rain would most likely give them a chill.&nbsp; For
his part he had heard that the little inn here was comfortable,
and he meant to stay.&nbsp; At last the young farmer agreed to
put up there also; and they dismounted, and entered, and had a
good supper together, and talked over their affairs like men who
had known and proved each other a long time.&nbsp; When it was
the hour for retiring they went upstairs to a double-bedded room
which Georgy Crookhill had asked the landlord to let them share,
so sociable were they.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before they fell asleep they talked across the room
about one thing and another, running from this to that till the
conversation turned upon disguises, and changing clothes for
particular ends.&nbsp; The farmer told Georgy that he had often
heard tales of people doing it; but Crookhill professed to be
very ignorant of all such tricks; and soon the young farmer sank
into slumber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Early in the morning, while the tall young farmer was
still asleep (I tell the story as &rsquo;twas told me), honest
Georgy crept out of his bed by stealth, and dressed himself in
the farmer&rsquo;s clothes, in the pockets of the said clothes
being the farmer&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; Now though Georgy
particularly wanted the farmer&rsquo;s nice clothes and nice
horse, owing to a little transaction at the fair which made it
desirable that he should not be too easily recognized, his
desires had their bounds: he did not wish to take his young
friend&rsquo;s money, at any rate more of it than was necessary
for paying his bill.&nbsp; This he abstracted, and leaving the
farmer&rsquo;s purse containing the rest on the bedroom table,
went downstairs.&nbsp; The inn folks had not particularly noticed
the faces of their customers, and the one or two who were up at
this hour had no thought but that Georgy was the farmer; so when
he had paid the bill very liberally, and said he must be off, no
objection was made to his getting the farmer&rsquo;s horse
saddled for himself; and he rode away upon it as if it were his
own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About half an hour after the young farmer awoke, and
looking across the room saw that his friend Georgy had gone away
in clothes which didn&rsquo;t belong to him, and had kindly left
for himself the seedy ones worn by Georgy.&nbsp; At this he sat
up in a deep thought for some time, instead of hastening to give
an alarm.&nbsp; &ldquo;The money, the money is gone,&rdquo; he
said to himself, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s bad.&nbsp; But so are
the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He then looked upon the table and saw that the money,
or most of it, had been left behind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; he cried, and began to dance
about the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; he said again,
and made beautiful smiles to himself in the shaving glass and in
the brass candlestick; and then swung about his arms for all the
world as if he were going through the sword exercise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When he had dressed himself in Georgy&rsquo;s clothes
and gone downstairs, he did not seem to mind at all that they
took him for the other; and even when he saw that he had been
left a bad horse for a good one, he was not inclined to cry
out.&nbsp; They told him his friend had paid the bill, at which
he seemed much pleased, and without waiting for breakfast he
mounted Georgy&rsquo;s horse and rode away likewise, choosing the
nearest by-lane in preference to the high-road, without knowing
that Georgy had chosen that by-lane also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had not trotted more than two miles in the personal
character of Georgy Crookhill when, suddenly rounding a bend that
the lane made thereabout, he came upon a man struggling in the
hands of two village constables.&nbsp; It was his friend Georgy,
the borrower of his clothes and horse.&nbsp; But so far was the
young farmer from showing any alacrity in rushing forward to
claim his property that he would have turned the poor beast he
rode into the wood adjoining, if he had not been already
perceived.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Help, help, help!&rdquo; cried the
constables.&nbsp; &ldquo;Assistance in the name of the
Crown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The young farmer could do nothing but ride
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he
inquired, as coolly as he could.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A deserter&mdash;a deserter!&rdquo; said
they.&nbsp; &ldquo;One who&rsquo;s to be tried by court-martial
and shot without parley.&nbsp; He deserted from the Dragoons at
Cheltenham some days ago, and was tracked; but the search-party
can&rsquo;t find him anywhere, and we told &rsquo;em if we met
him we&rsquo;d hand him on to &rsquo;em forthwith.&nbsp; The day
after he left the barracks the rascal met a respectable farmer
and made him drunk at an inn, and told him what a fine soldier he
would make, and coaxed him to change clothes, to see how well a
military uniform would become him.&nbsp; This the simple farmer
did; when our deserter said that for a joke he would leave the
room and go to the landlady, to see if she would know him in that
dress.&nbsp; He never came back, and Farmer Jollice found himself
in soldier&rsquo;s clothes, the money in his pockets gone, and,
when he got to the stable, his horse gone too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;A scoundrel!&rdquo; says the young man in
Georgy&rsquo;s clothes.&nbsp; &ldquo;And is this the wretched
caitiff?&rdquo; (pointing to Georgy).</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cries Georgy, as innocent as a
babe of this matter of the soldier&rsquo;s desertion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man!&nbsp; He was wearing Farmer
Jollice&rsquo;s suit o&rsquo; clothes, and he slept in the same
room wi&rsquo; me, and brought up the subject of changing
clothes, which put it into my head to dress myself in his suit
before he was awake.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got on mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear the villain?&rdquo; groans the
tall young man to the constables.&nbsp; &ldquo;Trying to get out
of his crime by charging the first innocent man with it that he
sees!&nbsp; No, master soldier&mdash;that won&rsquo;t
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, no!&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo; the
constables chimed in.&nbsp; &ldquo;To have the impudence to say
such as that, when we caught him in the act almost!&nbsp; But,
thank God, we&rsquo;ve got the handcuffs on him at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We have, thank God,&rdquo; said the tall young
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I must move on.&nbsp; Good luck to ye
with your prisoner!&rdquo;&nbsp; And off he went, as fast as his
poor jade would carry him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The constables then, with Georgy handcuffed between
&rsquo;em, and leading the horse, marched off in the other
direction, toward the village where they had been accosted by the
escort of soldiers sent to bring the deserter back, Georgy
groaning: &ldquo;I shall be shot, I shall be shot!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They had not gone more than a mile before they met them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hoi, there!&rdquo; says the head constable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Hoi, yerself!&rdquo; says the corporal in
charge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got your man,&rdquo; says the
constable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; says the corporal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Here, between us,&rdquo; said the
constable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only you don&rsquo;t recognize him out
o&rsquo; uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The corporal looked at Georgy hard enough; then shook
his head and said he was not the absconder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But the absconder changed clothes with Farmer
Jollice, and took his horse; and this man has &rsquo;em,
d&rsquo;ye see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not our man,&rdquo; said the
soldiers.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tall young fellow with a mole
on his right cheek, and a military bearing, which this man
decidedly has not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I told the two officers of justice that
&rsquo;twas the other!&rdquo; pleaded Georgy.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
they wouldn&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so it became clear that the missing dragoon was the
tall young farmer, and not Georgy Crookhill&mdash;a fact which
Farmer Jollice himself corroborated when he arrived on the
scene.&nbsp; As Georgy had only robbed the robber, his sentence
was comparatively light.&nbsp; The deserter from the Dragoons was
never traced: his double shift of clothing having been of the
greatest advantage to him in getting off; though he left
Georgy&rsquo;s horse behind him a few miles ahead, having found
the poor creature more hindrance than aid.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The man from abroad seemed to be less interested in the
questionable characters of Longpuddle and their strange
adventures than in the ordinary inhabitants and the ordinary
events, though his local fellow-travellers preferred the former
as subjects of discussion.&nbsp; He now for the first time asked
concerning young persons of the opposite sex&mdash;or rather
those who had been young when he left his native land.&nbsp; His
informants, adhering to their own opinion that the remarkable was
better worth telling than the ordinary, would not allow him to
dwell upon the simple chronicles of those who had merely come and
gone.&nbsp; They asked him if he remembered Netty Sargent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Netty Sargent&mdash;I do, just remember her.&nbsp; She
was a young woman living with her uncle when I left, if my
childish recollection may be trusted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was the maid.&nbsp; She was a oneyer, if you like,
sir.&nbsp; Not any harm in her, you know, but up to
everything.&nbsp; You ought to hear how she got the copyhold of
her house extended.&nbsp; Oughtn&rsquo;t he, Mr. Day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He ought,&rsquo; replied the world-ignored old
painter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell him, Mr. Day.&nbsp; Nobody can do it better than
you, and you know the legal part better than some of
us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Day apologized, and began:&mdash;</p>
<h3>NETTY SARGENT&rsquo;S COPYHOLD</h3>
<p>&lsquo;She continued to live with her uncle, in the lonely
house by the copse, just as at the time you knew her; a tall spry
young woman.&nbsp; Ah, how well one can remember her black hair
and dancing eyes at that time, and her sly way of screwing up her
mouth when she meant to tease ye!&nbsp; Well, she was hardly out
of short frocks before the chaps were after her, and by long and
by late she was courted by a young man whom perhaps you did not
know&mdash;Jasper Cliff was his name&mdash;and, though she might
have had many a better fellow, he so greatly took her fancy that
&rsquo;twas Jasper or nobody for her.&nbsp; He was a selfish
customer, always thinking less of what he was going to do than of
what he was going to gain by his doings.&nbsp; Jasper&rsquo;s
eyes might have been fixed upon Netty, but his mind was upon her
uncle&rsquo;s house; though he was fond of her in his way&mdash;I
admit that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This house, built by her great-great-grandfather, with
its garden and little field, was copyhold&mdash;granted upon
lives in the old way, and had been so granted for
generations.&nbsp; Her uncle&rsquo;s was the last life upon the
property; so that at his death, if there was no admittance of new
lives, it would all fall into the hands of the lord of the
manor.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas easy to admit&mdash;a slight
&ldquo;fine,&rdquo; as &rsquo;twas called, of a few pounds, was
enough to entitle him to a new deed o&rsquo; grant by the custom
of the manor; and the lord could not hinder it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now there could be no better provision for his niece
and only relative than a sure house over her head, and
Netty&rsquo;s uncle should have seen to the renewal in time,
owing to the peculiar custom of forfeiture by the dropping of the
last life before the new fine was paid; for the Squire was very
anxious to get hold of the house and land; and every Sunday when
the old man came into the church and passed the Squire&rsquo;s
pew, the Squire would say, &ldquo;A little weaker in his knees, a
little crookeder in his back&mdash;and the readmittance not
applied for: ha! ha!&nbsp; I shall be able to make a complete
clearing of that corner of the manor some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas extraordinary, now we look back upon it,
that old Sargent should have been so dilatory; yet some people
are like it; and he put off calling at the Squire&rsquo;s
agent&rsquo;s office with the fine week after week, saying to
himself, &ldquo;I shall have more time next market-day than I
have now.&rdquo;&nbsp; One unfortunate hindrance was that he
didn&rsquo;t very well like Jasper Cliff; and as Jasper kept
urging Netty, and Netty on that account kept urging her uncle,
the old man was inclined to postpone the re-liveing as long as he
could, to spite the selfish young lover.&nbsp; At last old Mr.
Sargent fell ill, and then Jasper could bear it no longer: he
produced the fine-money himself, and handed it to Netty, and
spoke to her plainly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You and your uncle ought to know better.&nbsp;
You should press him more.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the money.&nbsp;
If you let the house and ground slip between ye, I won&rsquo;t
marry; hang me if I will!&nbsp; For folks won&rsquo;t deserve a
husband that can do such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The worried girl took the money and went home, and told
her uncle that it was no house no husband for her.&nbsp; Old Mr.
Sargent pooh-poohed the money, for the amount was not worth
consideration, but he did now bestir himself; for he saw she was
bent upon marrying Jasper, and he did not wish to make her
unhappy, since she was so determined.&nbsp; It was much to the
Squire&rsquo;s annoyance that he found Sargent had moved in the
matter at last; but he could not gainsay it, and the documents
were prepared (for on this manor the copy-holders had writings
with their holdings, though on some manors they had none).&nbsp;
Old Sargent being now too feeble to go to the agent&rsquo;s
house, the deed was to be brought to his house signed, and handed
over as a receipt for the money; the counterpart to be signed by
Sargent, and sent back to the Squire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The agent had promised to call on old Sargent for this
purpose at five o&rsquo;clock, and Netty put the money into her
desk to have it close at hand.&nbsp; While doing this she heard a
slight cry from her uncle, and turning round, saw that he had
fallen forward in his chair.&nbsp; She went and lifted him, but
he was unconscious; and unconscious he remained.&nbsp; Neither
medicine nor stimulants would bring him to himself.&nbsp; She had
been told that he might possibly go off in that way, and it
seemed as if the end had come.&nbsp; Before she had started for a
doctor his face and extremities grew quite cold and white, and
she saw that help would be useless.&nbsp; He was stone-dead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Netty&rsquo;s situation rose upon her distracted mind
in all its seriousness.&nbsp; The house, garden, and field were
lost&mdash;by a few hours&mdash;and with them a home for herself
and her lover.&nbsp; She would not think so meanly of Jasper as
to suppose that he would adhere to the resolution declared in a
moment of impatience; but she trembled, nevertheless.&nbsp; Why
could not her uncle have lived a couple of hours longer, since he
had lived so long?&nbsp; It was now past three o&rsquo;clock; at
five the agent was to call, and, if all had gone well, by ten
minutes past five the house and holding would have been securely
hers for her own and Jasper&rsquo;s lives, these being two of the
three proposed to be added by paying the fine.&nbsp; How that
wretched old Squire would rejoice at getting the little tenancy
into his hands!&nbsp; He did not really require it, but
constitutionally hated these tiny copyholds and leaseholds and
freeholds, which made islands of independence in the fair, smooth
ocean of his estates.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then an idea struck into the head of Netty how to
accomplish her object in spite of her uncle&rsquo;s
negligence.&nbsp; It was a dull December afternoon: and the first
step in her scheme&mdash;so the story goes, and I see no reason
to doubt it&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis true as the light,&rsquo; affirmed
Christopher Twink.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was just passing by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The first step in her scheme was to fasten the outer
door, to make sure of not being interrupted.&nbsp; Then she set
to work by placing her uncle&rsquo;s small, heavy oak table
before the fire; then she went to her uncle&rsquo;s corpse,
sitting in the chair as he had died&mdash;a stuffed arm-chair, on
casters, and rather high in the seat, so it was told me&mdash;and
wheeled the chair, uncle and all, to the table, placing him with
his back toward the window, in the attitude of bending over the
said oak table, which I knew as a boy as well as I know any piece
of furniture in my own house.&nbsp; On the table she laid the
large family Bible open before him, and placed his forefinger on
the page; and then she opened his eyelids a bit, and put on him
his spectacles, so that from behind he appeared for all the world
as if he were reading the Scriptures.&nbsp; Then she unfastened
the door and sat down, and when it grew dark she lit a candle,
and put it on the table beside her uncle&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Folk may well guess how the time passed with her till
the agent came, and how, when his knock sounded upon the door,
she nearly started out of her skin&mdash;at least that&rsquo;s as
it was told me.&nbsp; Netty promptly went to the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am sorry, sir,&rdquo; she says, under her
breath; &ldquo;my uncle is not so well to-night, and I&rsquo;m
afraid he can&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&mdash;that&rsquo;s a pretty
tale,&rdquo; says the steward.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve come
all this way about this trumpery little job for
nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O no, sir&mdash;I hope not,&rdquo; says
Netty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose the business of granting the new
deed can be done just the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Done?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; He must pay the
renewal money, and sign the parchment in my presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She looked dubious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Uncle is so dreadful
nervous about law business,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;that, as you
know, he&rsquo;s put it off and put it off for years; and now
to-day really I&rsquo;ve feared it would verily drive him out of
his mind.&nbsp; His poor three teeth quite chattered when I said
to him that you would be here soon with the parchment
writing.&nbsp; He always was afraid of agents, and folks that
come for rent, and such-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Poor old fellow&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry for
him.&nbsp; Well, the thing can&rsquo;t be done unless I see him
and witness his signature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Suppose, sir, that you see him sign, and he
don&rsquo;t see you looking at him?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d soothe his
nerves by saying you weren&rsquo;t strict about the form of
witnessing, and didn&rsquo;t wish to come in.&nbsp; So that it
was done in your bare presence it would be sufficient, would it
not?&nbsp; As he&rsquo;s such an old, shrinking, shivering man,
it would be a great considerateness on your part if that would
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;In my bare presence would do, of
course&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I come for.&nbsp; But how can I be
a witness without his seeing me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, in this way, sir; if you&rsquo;ll oblige me
by just stepping here.&rdquo;&nbsp; She conducted him a few yards
to the left, till they were opposite the parlour window.&nbsp;
The blind had been left up purposely, and the candle-light shone
out upon the garden bushes.&nbsp; Within the agent could see, at
the other end of the room, the back and side of the old
man&rsquo;s head, and his shoulders and arm, sitting with the
book and candle before him, and his spectacles on his nose, as
she had placed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s reading his Bible, as you see,
sir,&rdquo; she says, quite in her meekest way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I thought he was a careless sort of
man in matters of religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;He always was fond of his Bible,&rdquo; Netty
assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though I think he&rsquo;s nodding over
it just at this moment However, that&rsquo;s natural in an old
man, and unwell.&nbsp; Now you could stand here and see him sign,
couldn&rsquo;t you, sir, as he&rsquo;s such an
invalid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the agent, lighting a
cigar.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have ready by you the merely nominal sum
you&rsquo;ll have to pay for the admittance, of
course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Netty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
bring it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; She fetched the cash, wrapped in
paper, and handed it to him, and when he had counted it the
steward took from his breast pocket the precious parchments and
gave one to her to be signed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Uncle&rsquo;s hand is a little paralyzed,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what with his being half asleep, too,
really I don&rsquo;t know what sort of a signature he&rsquo;ll be
able to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t matter, so that he
signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Might I hold his hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ay, hold his hand, my young woman&mdash;that
will be near enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Netty re-entered the house, and the agent continued
smoking outside the window.&nbsp; Now came the ticklish part of
Netty&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp; The steward saw her put the
inkhorn&mdash;&ldquo;horn,&rdquo; says I in my old-fashioned
way&mdash;the inkstand, before her uncle, and touch his elbow as
to arouse him, and speak to him, and spread out the deed; when
she had pointed to show him where to sign she dipped the pen and
put it into his hand.&nbsp; To hold his hand she artfully stepped
behind him, so that the agent could only see a little bit of his
head, and the hand she held; but he saw the old man&rsquo;s hand
trace his name on the document.&nbsp; As soon as &rsquo;twas done
she came out to the steward with the parchment in her hand, and
the steward signed as witness by the light from the parlour
window.&nbsp; Then he gave her the deed signed by the Squire, and
left; and next morning Netty told the neighbours that her uncle
was dead in his bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must have undressed him and put him
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She must.&nbsp; Oh, that girl had a nerve, I can tell
ye!&nbsp; Well, to cut a long story short, that&rsquo;s how she
got back the house and field that were, strictly speaking, gone
from her; and by getting them, got her a husband.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every virtue has its reward, they say.&nbsp; Netty had
hers for her ingenious contrivance to gain Jasper.&nbsp; Two
years after they were married he took to beating her&mdash;not
hard, you know; just a smack or two, enough to set her in a
temper, and let out to the neighbours what she had done to win
him, and how she repented of her pains.&nbsp; When the old Squire
was dead, and his son came into the property, this confession of
hers began to be whispered about.&nbsp; But Netty was a pretty
young woman, and the Squire&rsquo;s son was a pretty young man at
that time, and wider-minded than his father, having no objection
to little holdings; and he never took any proceedings against
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was now a lull in the discourse, and soon the van
descended the hill leading into the long straggling
village.&nbsp; When the houses were reached the passengers
dropped off one by one, each at his or her own door.&nbsp;
Arrived at the inn, the returned emigrant secured a bed, and
having eaten a light meal, sallied forth upon the scene he had
known so well in his early days.&nbsp; Though flooded with the
light of the rising moon, none of the objects wore the
attractiveness in this their real presentation that had ever
accompanied their images in the field of his imagination when he
was more than two thousand miles removed from them.&nbsp; The
peculiar charm attaching to an old village in an old country, as
seen by the eyes of an absolute foreigner, was lowered in his
case by magnified expectations from infantine memories.&nbsp; He
walked on, looking at this chimney and that old wall, till he
came to the churchyard, which he entered.</p>
<p>The head-stones, whitened by the moon, were easily
decipherable; and now for the first time Lackland began to feel
himself amid the village community that he had left behind him
five-and-thirty years before.&nbsp; Here, besides the Sallets,
the Darths, the Pawles, the Privetts, the Sargents, and others of
whom he had just heard, were names he remembered even better than
those: the Jickses, and the Crosses, and the Knights, and the
Olds.&nbsp; Doubtless representatives of these families, or some
of them, were yet among the living; but to him they would all be
as strangers.&nbsp; Far from finding his heart ready-supplied
with roots and tendrils here, he perceived that in returning to
this spot it would be incumbent upon him to re-establish himself
from the beginning, precisely as though he had never known the
place, nor it him.&nbsp; Time had not condescended to wait his
pleasure, nor local life his greeting.</p>
<p>The figure of Mr. Lackland was seen at the inn, and in the
village street, and in the fields and lanes about Upper
Longpuddle, for a few days after his arrival, and then,
ghost-like, it silently disappeared.&nbsp; He had told some of
the villagers that his immediate purpose in coming had been
fulfilled by a sight of the place, and by conversation with its
inhabitants: but that his ulterior purpose&mdash;of coming to
spend his latter days among them&mdash;would probably never be
carried out.&nbsp; It is now a dozen or fifteen years since his
visit was paid, and his face has not again been seen.</p>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
